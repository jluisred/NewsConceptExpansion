Banks are meant to look after your cash and your savings, but no one expects them to tell you how to break the law to escape the tax that you owe. Until now, that is. Leaked files have shown how more than a thousand people from Britain with secretive Swiss bank accounts, and thousands more around the world, were helped and advised by HSBC on how to hide their money from the tax man. David Cameron made the boss of the bank at the time not just  a trade minister, but a peer of the realm. Your bankers were helping people dodge tax. Why did you let them do that? As I think I’ve explained I am not prepared to make any comments on HSBC's business past or present.  Lord Green won’t say what he new about the bank at the time and Ministers won’t say what they asked him. But how can you defend them? Sorry, I am not prepared to make any comments on HSBC. As he’s no longer a minister it is the man who hired him  who is facing the questions. Well Steven Green was an excellent trade minister, he did a good job, but I’ll also add that no government has done more than this one to crack down on tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. The evidence of what happened eight years ago at HSBC comes in the form of a massive trail of once private bank documents analysed by the BBC and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. This tax bombshell has been ticking since 2007 when an HSBC whistleblower stole files from his bank. Three years later the French who’d be looking at them, sent them on to the British tax authorities. A few months later David Cameron gave Steven Green a peerage and then Lord Green was appointed trade minister. Labour are demanding to know what checks were made before the man from the bank got his government job. “Any failure by this government to question Steven Green before his appointment would be an inexplicable and inexcusable abdication of responsibility” The tories pointed out that the revenue asked for those incriminating HSBC files when Labour was still in power, what’s more they argue that what went wrong dates back even earlier. Their party officer was in government in 2005 and 2007 that’s where, thats when these allegations relate to they relate to activity in 2005 to 2007. The debate here in Westminster has focused all on who knew what and when, but others are asking why more money wasn’t raised from these tax avoiders? Just 135 millions being raised so far. But why more of them haven’t ended up in court if not in prison. So far, we’ve only had one prosecution of somebody in the court. You could think if this has been benefit scrunching they had been queuing on the courts to have their cases heard. Not perhaps the ideal night for David Cameron to welcome his richest supporters to a tory ball expected to raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for the party. Nick Robinson, BBC News, Westminster.
