The concept of putting the LCD in front of the microwave that I will show you a 
heat map of your food, so for example in the case of eating a frozen a burger 
alright you put that in there the first is all blue, but as soon as it gets warmer to 
it goes to the temperature scale and visual goes from blue, to yellow, to red, to white 
once it is like fully cooked. 
But it even goes even beyond that because you could, you know, put some soups in the microwave 
and you can go upstairs and you can wirelessly send that signals to your phone
so you can keep track in another room, fairly straightforward in the fact of having 
an IR sensor camera at the top of the microwave and that there is a microprocessor 
that sort of takes the images and from there it feeds in a LCD screen.
I think all these concepts of Internet of Things and everything being connected it is only a matter of time. You can even like have a connected microwave that crowdsources, 
you work with other microwaves still all work together for finding the perfect time 
for any individual product, so I got another variation on how to go.
