Regina is 2 years old. She lives with her family and enjoys life, but she is ill with a brain disorder that means she may not have long to live. “When she was born we were expecting the worst, we thought she would die straight away which is what the doctors had told us. But, as it turned out, she survived. For her parents joy, regina confounded the doctors predictions, but for the rest of her life, she will need specialized palliative care to help manage her condition. This type of care should be available to all patients with a chronic or terminal illness.  Access to palliative care has been a legal right in Mexico for the past five years, but human rights activists say this law has not been backed up by action meaning many people are suffering unnecessarily. Regina’s doctor is Yuriko Nakashima, palliative care specialist. “ Palliative care is a combination of biological, social and spiritual care we give to patients who don’t have a realistic chance of recovery and whose death can be predicted within about six months.” One of the main problems is the difficulty in getting vital pain relieving drugs like morphine . The emergency doctor has to send us an internal request saying there is a patient who needs pain relief. Once I get that request, I then have to fill in a special form with a barcode and that gets sent to the pharmacy. Doctor Nakashima is used to navigating the system, but the majority of doctors aren’t. Hardly any medical schools include palliative care in their training. That is why doctor Nakashima holds classes in her hospital. To help doctors understand why it is important and how to give it.   In all our training we were never taught anything about palliative care, but now I’ve learned that palliative care isn’t just about helping patients to die well, it’s about helping them to live well too. The organisation human rights watch say the Mexican government has just started taking action to improve access to palliative care. Things have been changing the government adopted  kind of the implementing regulations for the health law. The next kind of big questions are making sure that hospitals actually create palliative care teams and to make sure that there is training.  In the end we all are going to die one day, but we can influence how we do it. How we keep on living until we have to say good bye. Regina’s family cherish every day they have with their daughter and they confort in the fact that she is not suffering, and if the changes being brought into the system now are successful, many more patients could benefit from similar care in the future.
