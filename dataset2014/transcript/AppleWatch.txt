The Apple watch.

It is already the world's most valuable company, and now Apple is hopping that its brand's new gadget will earn it even more money.
The Apple watch is the most advanced time piece ever created. The watch is Apple's first totally new product since the Ipad five years ago and the company is betting and yet again it's invented something people didn't even know they wanted. It's starts at a higher price that most of the smart watches, and the gold version will cost as most as thirteen thousand pounds.
So what exactly can the Apple watch do? It has to be connected to an Iphone to work and then make calls and see emails and text on your wrist. The watch can be used as a mobile wallet to pay for things but for now only in the United States and it can monitor your health and fitness.
So the thing of this device that you use to check your mail or facebook can be used to battle desease is really simply amazing. The company also unveiled the plan to allow medical researches to use information collected from Iphone and watch users, while promising that it would not see that data. You decide when your data is shared, and Apple will not see your data. Apple is rarely first with new technology, the Iphone wasn't the first smarthphone but it's been a huge money spinner. The Ipad wasn't the first tablet, but it has sold pretty well. As for smarth watches, well there were plenty of them already on the market, Apple now has to probe we need yet another new gadget on our wrists. 
Last week saw a clutch of new smarth watches unveiled at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress, including this from a small firm called Pebble, whose founder hopes Apple will grow the market. 
I think the opportunity is massive. I think there is gonna be millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of smarth watches on people's wrists within the next couple of years. I think Apple is a massive company, there're a worthy competitor and definitely bringing an interesting perspective to the table. 
But as we find in London's Carnaby street today, lots of younger people just don't wear watches anymore. Apple's challenge is to make glancing in your wrist rather than your phone fashionable again.
