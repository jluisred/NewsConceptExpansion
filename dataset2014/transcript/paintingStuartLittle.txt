Suddenly, I came very excited and my daugther didn't understand why I was so excited. That was it. That was the first scene where I realized that there is a Bereny's painting behind Hugh Laurie. I was a blink-and-you-miss-it moment, but there, in the film Stuart Little, was the long-lost work of avant-garde painter Robert Bereny. 
I took it lika a miracle of Christmast for me, it was a gift for hungarian art historians, and after Christmast I started to make contact with the film makers. He tracked it down to a former set designer on the film who picked it up for around five hundred dollars. She sold it to a private collector who brought the picture to Budapest to be auctionned. it fetched more than 285.000 dollars when it went under the hammer. The find even prompted one of the starts of the film, Hugh Laurie to tweet "little hurt to discover the foreground performances couldn't hold the attention, but still, what an honour."
The art historians say there are hundreds more gems hidden in plain sight, all you need is a little help. Laura Westbrook, BBC News.
