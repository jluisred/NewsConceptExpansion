We have ignition of NASA's Space Launch System, five segments, solid rocket to start. 
Well, there it goes, the astonishing sight, there in the desert, and watching this picture with me this doctor, Adan Baker, senior lecturer at Kingston University, has described this as a significant moment, as we continue to watch these pictures. Doctor, just describe to us, so what are they actually testing here and the significance of this moment.
"They are testing what is called solid rocket booster which is one of the two main types of engines forming the base, the boost stage of something called the Space Launch System, which is now also known Ultra large Launch Field, covered there in the process of developing for future machines to asteroids and to potentially Mars, with their astronaut crews"
"And this is critical, getting this parsed, of the whole equation where you eventually get a man spaceship that can get to Mars, critically, this is one of the absolute key first practices, isn’t?.”
"Absolutely, the propulsion system has to work no question about it and the boosters are the main part that physically lifts the launch vehicle off the ground and gets it going."
"Am I not right in saying, in one sense is old technology, in terms of the boosters? Is that right?"
"Oh yes, it is an impressive test, visually, but they are actually using technologies well over a hundred years old, older than that if you consider the Chinese were using solid rocket boosters in fireworks several hundreds years ago, and Nasa has had equally efficient similar size rockets engines for forty five years or most since the Moon program. so this is actually quite old know how.
