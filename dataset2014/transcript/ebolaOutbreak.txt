It’s time for the fresh delivery of water to a community in lock down. In one of the poorest slums in Freetown around 200 people rely on outside supplies to survive. Food has to be brought in too. Behind the flimsy barrier, a woman died of Ebola two weeks ago. Now everyone is in quarantine. This woman says that they don’t get enough food and every new Ebola of infection means the quarantine period of 21 days starts again. That’s happened twice. Despite the restrictions one man escaped, and it’s just been confirmed he’s the cause of 31 new infections, and the quarantine of a village of 500 people. “Can I go in?” “Of course”. Other Sierra Leonians are showing better judgement. “Mr. vice president, how are you”  One of Samuel Sam-Sumana’s bodyguards has just died killed by the virus. So now it’s the country’s deputy leader who’s quarantined himself at his residence. He agreed to speak with us, from a distance.  I have resolved to be part of what it takes the exercise that we have been endeavored with to make sure that we inform our people quickly what are the things that they need to do. So the battle against ebola is fragile, and could become even more difficult if Sierra Leona’s borders with it’s neighbors aren’t secured. We traveled on a British military chopper to the frontier with Guinea. And this is the village of Valamuya quarantined behind a washing line.  Population 100. For two months there were no infections, then a single case early in February and four more. The troupes are forcing the quarantine, taking whatever precaution they can. The local chief blames the Ebola cases on Guinea “Only when they open their market places there people leave there to go and do trading.” On Sierra Leona’s side the markets are shut. Securing this area along the border with Guinea is key to preventing the spread of Ebola deeper inside Sierra Leona, but it’s their poorest frontier and some traders anxious to protect their livelihood still want to come and go, despite quarantine efforts. In the worst affected countries transmission rates are down fewer people are getting Ebola. But it all it takes one person to undo the good work. Reaching zero transmission is still the stated aim of everyone, but is it achievable?  Clyde Miley BBC News, Sierra Leona.
