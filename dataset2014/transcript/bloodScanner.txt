Gene Radar is a mobile diagnostic device, in which you can take a drop of blood sliver 
or any other body fluid, stick it into a nano chip, insert into a mobile device 
and it in real time diagnoses what disease a person has. It works at DNA RNA level 
and it gives you with gold standard accuracy and diagnoses in real time.
The company is one of several now vising to introduce more efficient mobile solutions
to vie scanning, which could cost, in some conditions, by up to 99%.
We can diagnose Ebola pre-symptomatically that is before patient shows fever, so people who 
are coming in a flight Gene Radar enables the detection of the virus at the very low copied numbers.
The entire health care industry is based on a paradigm of centralized infrastructure, a 
paradigm that is rude in the industrial revolution of the seventy hundreds.
The results is today we have over 4 billion people who don't have access to basic health care.
I believe that the next generation of health care will be more democratize, more 
decentralized, more mobilized, more personalized. And the new tools coming from the synthesis 
of physics, nano-technology, bio-medicine, information communication technology, 
that enable this new generation of health care infrastructure to be shared with the world.
