A year ago it was full steam ahead to the high north, maritime energy and minign companies were commiting billions. The summer shipping began navigating the new north-east passage through this icy last frontier, it comes to usual it can have a journey time by ten days. But the economic climate has turned harsher, and the halving of oil prices and the tensions with Russia, one of the eight nations with arctic interests has scared investors who may have to wait decades for returns.

The summit will hear that the Arctic hype of recent years has been receding with the sea ice, but all prices are far from giving up. "The Arctic is a very diverse area, and there are regions in the Arctic that are quite similar to areas where there are already our oiling gas production like in the Norwegian sea, but of course there are also areas that are much more complicated and to overcome some of these challenges it need to be worked on, and we are thinking specifically about oil spill preparedness and about emergency and emergency preparedness and evacuation."
After a quarter of all undiscovered oil and gas may lie here, in with oil and a hundred and ten dollars a barrel extracting a fraction of it from such inhospitable terrain was going to be hard with the ever present risk of doing irreversible damage. Norway Statoil the latest to delay planned operations deep in the Arctic Circle citing high cost, but for once Shell seems determined to try to recoup its vast investment of Alaska telling the BBC it is still hot to start drilling in the summer. 
"We believe that the Arctic probably holds the largest yet-to-be-discovered resource base, if you look at our position in the Alaska part of the Arctic and the West in Churchill, it is very substantial indeed. It is kind of hard to take a view on how much will be there but we are talking about multi-billion barrels resource potential"
The United States is now taking the chair of the intergovernmental Arctic council. Critics say its lagging behind rivals, notably Russia, which is forging ahead with developing poor services.
For now the economics of development in the Arctic is as fragile as the environment and the regional politics.
