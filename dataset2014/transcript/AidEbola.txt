This lot weren't even born when the original band aid single came out. Nor was he. Or her, for that matter. But they will all be appearing on the 30th anniversary version with some old timers to keep them company. In 1984 it was about raising money to fight famime in Africa. In 2014 it's about Ebola. 
This filthy desease makes humans untouchable, so no mother can confort their dying child, no lover can cradle each other, this fairly silly little song is in attempt to actually reach out and touch. The project is about supporting the fight against Ebola in West Africa. The song, his way of doing it.
There is nothing to do whether you like the record or not, or whether you approve of the artists or not or how good the recording is, that will be part of it. It is simply a way of saying this Christmas, yeah, yeah, no, let's stop this here. 
In 1984 an equally simple message aligned to this song raised millions of pounds. The candy updated version "Repeat the Feat" in today's digital world. 
Around thirty years ago when that Band Aid single first came out I was working here in Tottenhan court road in a record shop. Back then the music business was a fairly simple affair, people went it with their money and came out with a single. Now things have changed an awful lot since then, for example the shop I worked in and that many like it no longer exists.
And the way we access and listen to music is completely different. 
In terms of sales, like for like sales of the actual track, I think you'll probably unlikely to see that of the original Band Aid, but in terms of awereness, and it is difficult to kind of measure this, when is all about kind of facebook shares and retweets, I think Bob Geldof and the campaign will be hoping that it can reach even more people than the original campaign.
And that means if the new version of this song doesn't do well, other initiatives such as the DEC appeal which has already received 15 million pounds in public donations could be the beneficiaries from Band Aid's latest come back.
