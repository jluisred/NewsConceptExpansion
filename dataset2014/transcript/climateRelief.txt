Scientist agree that we must take rapid actions to combat climat change. More extreme weather more often means the need to agree in a global response is pressing. 
A good idea if you agree to call this document the Lima call for climate action. So if you agree it is all decided. After days and nighs of fierce arguments, politicians meeting in Lima finally reached unlimited agreement about what they intend to do about it.
This is what has been agreed: new rules that will clarify the pledges that individual countries will make. The UN will add up all this pledges by next October, and there will be a broader range of nations who'll have to take on commitments. While acknowledging it isn't perfect, most developed countries welcome the deal.
Lima deal unlocks the door to the big climate change deal that we need in Paris next year. It's been tough, it's been up all night, we've sweated to get this deal, but we have to do it for our children and grandchilden, as the threat of climate change is so severe, but today we have seen the world come together, the world united, so we can move to the action that we need next year in Paris.
But for enviromental campaigners and some smaller countries the agreement has seen as week and ineffectual. Delegates came to Lime with high hopes of putting in place the key elements of the new global deal, but days and nights of haggling here meant that many critical decisions has been posponed. That all makes secure in a new global treaty in Paris, this time next year, all the more difficult.
