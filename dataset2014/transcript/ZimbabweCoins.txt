About ten millions U.S. dollars worth of this coins are in circulation, but there are few takers partly because the consumers think that the Zim dollar is being brought through the back door.
The introduction of functional currencies such as the South African rands and even the United States dollars after the collapse of the Zim dollar has had its fair share of problems. One of them: there were not enough coins in the system so that created a problem of change, a consumer who walked to a till such as this one instead of getting his way in change, he will get products such as chocolates and even sweets. Now, to alleviate that problem, the central bank then decided to introduce bond coins.
The bond coins have been circulated through banks and finding their way into the retail sector, but most supermarkets are having to deal with the reluctant consumers.
"The response hasn’t been so good, there are a few costumers coming in with the bond coins and when it comes to giving them out as change most of our customers prefer the rand coins, or some would rather take the spar vouchers. 
Apart from dealing with the chronic shortage of loose change, the bond coins were also meant to address the pricing system. But this has not been really effective so far. The central bank now has had to come up with a new strategies.
"The only area where where we.. have some skepticism coming is that in this informal sector, maybe because they don't bank. The coins are meant for reserve banks, they are meant for the goverment, they are meant to benefit the lowly paid people in this economy who need the coin much more than they have made." 
However those who should be seen the inmediate benefit of the bond coins remains skeptical. 
"If I have a customer with bond coins I refuse it. Because if I want to give someone a change, they are not taking it". 
“Before the bond coins came, we'll be forced to either take credit lost that can be misplaced or end up washed up in your laundry or you end up having to buy sweets."
But expert say that introducing coins into the system is a drop in the ocean when it comes to solving the country's economic difficulties.
“Unless and until we deal with issues of productivity, then our economy is not going to be able to generate enough liquidity, cause when you are in a dollar environnement like we have done, you can not do quantitative easing, you can not create money, you can not print money, so what you have to do is to boost your productive base, your productive capacity. The millions of U.S. dollars worth of bond coins which makes up about two per cent of the current bank deposits, are proving very difficult to market, so it appears that in Zimbabwe money is actually quite a hard sell but it does depend which money."
