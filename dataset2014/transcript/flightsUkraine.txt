Ukraine: Moscow threatens to ban EU flights over Russia

… not holding back at all, and threatening to close Russian air space if the EU went to head with further sanctions, so that in effect, would mean that if European airlines are flying to Asia through Russia they’ve to go around Russia, so that would be a huge detour, that would make the longer journeys more expensive journeys. And mister Medvedev made clear he thought that it would lead to the bankruptcy of a number of western airlines. He also said that western sanctions would not lead to peace in Ukraine and he named China as an example of a country which also faced western sanctions going back to 1989, but which didn’t change  its political course so his message is very clear, Russia wouldn’t change its political course as a result of western sanctions. 

But of course there is this window open by the EU saying that if Russia does reverse its position in Ukraine this new sanctions or the threats of these new sanctions could be rolled back.
That is true, but I have to say, it is seen here, in Moscow, as a very small window. When you talk to Russian officials, Kremlin officials, they truly believe the west has got it in for Russia, and you got the feeling that trust is broken down completely between the kremlin and the west, it appears that president Putin doesn’t really trust western politicians, and the feeling is mutual, the EU, the United Stated, there is very little trust of the Russian authorities. And in that atmosphere: the lack of trust, and the lack of communication too, it is very difficult to find a way out of this crisis.
