\begin{abstract}

Relying on subtitles of an audiovisual content to extract named entities is a common method for describing and annotating news and events. However, previous studies on this area [Lilia] have revealed that this approach has multiple limitations, and what is being explicitly said in a particular news document is insufficient for reconstructing the whole context of the event. 

In this paper we demonstrate that by leveraging in Semantic Web techniques and the power of non-structured documents we can --automatically-- generate a description of the event that is much closer to the vision that the humans have about it. The result of this approach is not a simple set of entities, but a ranked list of concepts wich can be used to be displayed on a device o derive further enrichments.

We have evaluated the approach by comparing our automatic generated context with the one expected by the viewers over a set of newscasts from the BBC.

\section{Introduction}
The set of entities obtained from a traditional named entity extraction operation is insufficient and incomplete for expressing the context of a news event. Sometimes, some entities spotted over a particular document are not disambiguated because the textual clues surrounding the entity are not precise enough for the name entity extractor, while in other cases, they are simply not mentioned in the transcripts while being relevant for understanding the story. This is an inherent problem in information retrieval tasks: a single description about the same resource does not necessarily summarize the whole picture.

The named entity expansion operation relies on the idea of retrieving and analyzing additional documents from the Web where the same event is also described. By increasing the size of set of documents to analyse, we increase the completeness of the context and the representativeness of the list of entities, reinforcing relevant entities and finding new ones that are potentially interesting inside the context of that news item.

Concerning the multimedia annotation the literature covers a wide range of different analysis techniques~\cite{ballan2011event}. One of the main approaches consists on running Named Entity Recognition (NER) over the textual information attached to particular video fragment. Those techniques are an essential component within the Information Extraction field that focus on: identifying atomic information units in texts, named entities; classifying entities into predefined categories (also called context types) and linking to real world objects using web identifiers (Named Entity Disambiguation). A growing number of APIs provide such a service, like AlchemyAPI\footnote{\fontsize{8pt}{1em}\selectfont \url{http://www.alchemyapi.com/}} or DBpedia Spotlight\footnote{\fontsize{8pt}{1em}\selectfont \url{http://spotlight.dbpedia.org/}}. If the textual information attached to a video contains temporal references (e.g. subtitles), it is possible to align the entities with the time when they appear in the video. In this line, Yunjia et al.~\cite{yunjia2013} have probed that named entity recognition techniques applied on video subtitles can produce good results for video classification.

\section{News Concept Expansion Algorithm}
\label{sec:ConceptExpansion}

Brief description about the different steps in the whole process: query formulation, document collection, filtering strategies.

\subsection{Newscast Metadata}

%OLD APPROACH
%The \emph{Five W's} is a popular concept of information gathering in journalistic reporting. It captures the main aspects of a story: who, when, what, where, and why~\cite{LiJia2007}. We try to represent the news item in terms of four of those five W's (who is involved in the event, where the event is taking place, what the event is about, and when it has happened) in order to generate a query that retrieves documents associated to the same event.
%First, the original entities are mapped to the NERD Core ontology, which considers 10 main classes: Thing, Amount, Animal, Event, Function, Organization, Location, Person, Product and Time. From those ten different categories, we generalize to three classes: the Who from \url{nerd:Person} and \url{nerd:Organization}, the Where from \url{nerd:Location}, and the What from the rest of NERD types after discarding \url{nerd:Time} and \url{nerd:Amount}. 

Newscast broadcasters offer a certain amount of metadata about the items they publish, which is normally available together with the audiovisual content itself. In our research, we have considered newscasts come with the following information: the title or header of the newscast, day of publication and transcript of the video (non necessary timed). In conclusion, for each newscast the following triple is needed:

\begin{equation}
\text{Event} =\left [ \text{Title}, Time, \text{Transcript} \right ]
\end{equation}

Those different fields are taken from the video publisher and directly used as input for the rest of the expansion workflow without any pre-processing.

\subsection{Document Retrieval}

The quality of this steps is basinal.
Reach the limit of the property.
Emulates what a normal guy does but going further in the number of documents we can process.

The first step consist in building an adequate query to be will be injected into a document search engine where additional descriptions about the news event can be found. In our case, this query will have the following form:
 
\begin{equation}
\text{Query}_{Event} =\left [ \text{Text}, Time_{Window} \right ]
\end{equation}

The different behavior of search engines make some alternatives more suitable than others for certain kinds of events. The way the resulting documents change in the search engines for a particular kind of event is a research question that will not be studied in this paper. In this regard, we have relied on the Google Custom Search Engine API service\footnote{\fontsize{8pt}{1em}\selectfont  \url{https://www.google.com/cse/all}} by launching a query with the parameters specified in $\text{Query}_{Event}$. 

Due to quota restrictions imposed by Google, the maximum number of retrieved document is set to 30. However, as shown in the evaluation described in the Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}, this is enough for significantly extending the initial set of .

Concerning the temporal dimension, we only keep the documents published in the time period $t+t_{e}$. We increase the original event period in $t_{e}$ because documents concerning a news event are not always published during the time of the action is taking place but some hours or days after. The value of $t_{e}$ depends on many factors such as the nature of the event itself (whether it is a brief appearance in a media, or part of a longer story with more repercussion) or the kind of documents the search engine is indexing (from very deep and elaborated documents that need time to be published, to short post quickly generated by users). Based on the simple assumption that that the longer is an event, and the longer it is likely to generate buzzes, we approximated  $t_{e} = t$ which means that we also consider document published during the course of an event.


Dimensions:
1) Considered Web sites: 5 values: [AllGoogle, WhiteList, LiliasList, WhiteList\_AllGoogle, LiliasList\_AllGoogle]
2) Temporal dimension: 2 values: [2Weeks(default), 1Week]
3) Schema.org types: 2 values: [NoFilter(Default), Person\&OrganizationFiltered]

That makes 5 * 2 * 2 = 20 different runs. So far, we had 6 runs collected and annotated. Results will be show in evaluation.

The middle part of Figure~\ref{fig:namedEntityExpansion} shows this process. The query is input in the search engine in order to retrieve other documents that report on the same event discussed in the original video. Those documents (colored in black in the Figure~\ref{fig:namedEntityExpansion}) will be further processed to get additional insights about the news item in the form of relevant named entities.

\caption{Schema of Named Entity Expansion Algorithm.}
\label{fig:namedEntityExpansion}%\end{figure}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Entity Clustering}
In this phase, the additional documents which have just been retrieved are now processed and analyzed in order to extend and re-rank the original set of entities and consequently get a better insight about the event. Since most of the resources retrieved are Web pages, HTML tags and other annotations are removed, keeping only the main textual information. This plain text is then analyzed by the NERD framework in order to extract more named entities.

In order to calculate the frequency of a particular resource within the entire corpora, we group the different appearances of the same instance and check their cardinality. This is not a trivial task since the same entity can appear under different text labels, contain typos or have different disambiguation URL's pointing to the same resource. We performed a centroid-based clustering operation over the instances of the entities. We considered the centroid of a cluster as the entity with the most frequent disambiguation URL's that also have the most repeated labels. As distance metric for comparing pairs of entities, we applied strict string similarity over the URL's, and in case of mismatch, the Jaro-Winkler string distance~\cite{winkler2006overview} over the labels. The output of this phase is a list of clusters containing different instances of the same entity.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:Evaluation}

Introduction

\subsection{Dataset for evaluation}
Building the ground truth. Survey on 15 videos from the BBC about international facts. Evaluated over people in different countries.

* Explain the form: show automatically generated concepts + empty fields for suggesting possible missing entities.

* Show the results of the survey.

* Normalize GT
** How external items are measured.

\subsection{Measures}
 
Measurements in terms of Recall and Precision, at 7 (average number of results selected as relevant by the users)
 (No hay relacionn directa entre el numero de entidades seleccionadas. Se coge por tanto la media.)
 
In the evaluation we will focus in the highly ranked relevant documents. Similar to Web search engines, we will apply an evaluation measure which will try to find as many relevant documents as possible, while still keeping the  premise that the top ranked documents are the most important. We will not perform measures in terms of efficiency. Even this kind of study is easier to quantify (most of the time it can be measured automatically with a timer instead of with costly relevance judgments) this falls outside the scope of this paper. 

Those are the key efficiency measurements we would like to perform (Question: Should we try to do the same in Section "Selecting Ranking Pp"):

** Mean average precision at 10  - single number summary, popular measure, pooled
relevance judgments.

** Average NDCG - single number summary for each rank level, emphasizes top ranked documents, relevance judgments only needed to a speciffc rank depth
(in our example 10).

** Recall-precision graph - conveys more information than a single number measure, pooled relevance judgments.

** Average precision at rank 10 - emphasizes top ranked documents, easy to understand, relevance judgments limited to top 10.

We will use the same same ranking algorithm on five different queries. We aim of an averaging technique is to summarize the effectiveness of a specific ranking algorithm across a collection of queries. Different queries will then have different numbers of relevant documents, as is the case in this example. Figure about recall-precision for the top ten rank positions.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We presented an approach for context-aware annotating news events, designed to precisely harvest program descriptions starting from named entities recognized in TV video transcripts. Because the entities initially spotted are typically insufficient for covering the broader range of concepts that best describe a particular news clip, we expanded this set by analyzing additional textual documents about the same event.

The evaluation indicates that we can successfully expand the initial set of recognized entities with more relevant concepts not detected by pure named entity recognition approaches and produce a more accurate ranking of important concepts that brings forward entities which user are more interested about.

Future: tailor ranking to particular types of news: sport, politics, regional, international, opinion, etc.
