A handwritten note from America's most wanted man of the moment. This is Edward Snowden's latest application for Asylum, this time to Russia.
"A little over one month ago, I had a family, a home in paradise, and I lived in great comfort."
That was the former CIA employee talking to human rights activists in the Moscow airport where he’s been sampling the dubious comforts of living in the transit zone for the last three weeks. He's been behind closed doors as of the gaze of the army of journalists who've been desperate to catch a glimpse of him. His request for temporary asylum, though, could keep him held up here a lot longer.
“The request filed to the Federal Migration Service today according to current legislation.”
The examination can take up to three months. While this is being processed, he'll remain in the transit zone of the airport.
He's believed to have wanted to live Russia for somewhere in South America and has applied for asylum in at least 21 countries. So far Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela have all indicated that they could take him in, but he doesn't have any travel documents.
America, which would want Snowden to face trial for leaking national secrets, is calling on Russia to send him home.
“We don't have any extradition treaty with Russia. Broadly speaking our policy remains the same: that we'd like him returned based on previous law enforcement cooperation we'd had with Russia. We think there's a basis to do that. We would like to see him come home to face justice. He should have the courage to come home to the United States and face the criminal charges against him.”
The Kremlin says that any decision to grant him asylum wouldn't be down to president Putin. But the issue risks overshadowing president’s s Obama visit to Russia in September, so what to do about a man who's seen as a traitor to America is a question the Russian president may have to get personally involved in.
