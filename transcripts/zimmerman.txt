Rallies in Us over Zimmerman Verdict 
 
Don't forget Trayvon is the cry of these protestors in Washington DC.
 
Similar scenes are being played out across America in many of the big cities, including San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.
 
They're all unhappy at the outcome of one of America's most high profile cases.
 
"If that'd been a white boy who had been murdered, then, and a black guy who had murdered him, would they have acquitted him. Hell no! He would have been to jail for life and then some... "
 
"Anybody with any concern for social justice should be appalled that something like this happens in the United States of America.”
 
Neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman was acquitted on Saturday of murdering Trayvon Martin.
 
He said he shot the black teenager in self-defense, and the jury found him not guilty.
 
In a rare statement on a court case president Barack Obama called Martin’s death a tragedy for America, but he called for calmed reflection.
 
Although the protests have been mainly peaceful, feelings are still running high. Especially in Florida's black churches.
 
[Rev. Lowman Oliver, St. Paul's Baptist Church] "You choose which side you're going to be on, but if you sit still and do nothing, you have chosen on the evil side."
 
"Get up from where you are, and we need to get together and do something about it."
 
"It was the gun that killed Trayvon Martin, and tonight George Zimmerman..."
 
And for some, calm reflection will be particularly hard after this TV interview with the lawyer representing George Zimmerman.
 
"How do you think he feels about guns now?"
 
"I think that he feels truly in his heart, that if he would not have had that weapon that night, he would not be here."
 
"So do you think he would, if he could he would carry a gun again?"
 
"Yes"
 
George Zimmerman is now a free man, but his name is unlikely to fade from the headlines soon. The US Justice Department has said they will look into whether criminal civil rights charges can be brought against him.
 
He may also face lawsuits from Trayvon Martin's family.
