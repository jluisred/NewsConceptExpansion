Royal Baby Prince Named George

He will bear one of the most familiar and favorite names of  British kings in recent centuries: George.
It is the name William and Kate wanted, but it is also extremely traditional. First used by the Hanoverian kings of three hundred years ago, but more recently the name of the queen's late father, George the VI. A man who was propelled onto the throne by the abdication crisis, who overcame a crippling speech defect, and who with the support of his wife and two daughters: Elizabeth and Margaret, helped to restore his monarchy's reputation and the country's morale during the Second World War. 
This morning George the VI's elder daughter, our present queen, went to Kensington palace to see her great grand son, a child with the promise of returning her father's name to the throne. "It's a sort of heroic name and this is a way of honoring the queen, because it’s naming the baby after her father.
Prince George will have two other names, Alexander, which is said to be a favorite of Kate's, and Louis, a name from William's side of the family, it may well be a reference to prince Charles’s favorite great uncle, Earl Louis Mountbatten from Burma.
