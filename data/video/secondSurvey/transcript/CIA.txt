A grim report that has reignited the anguished debate in the United States and beyond over the harsh methods used in America’s desperate post 9/11 pursuit of intelligence. For some the very fact of this report is a sign of strength of the American System, but it’s new details on waterboarding and other brutal methods, have also prompted harsh new reactions. 
One of the main secret CIA detention centres was in Afghanistan and now from that country’s new president: “ The report is very shocking the UN’s Human’s Rights Law globally accepted humans rights practices and US government principles have been violated by some of the CIA’s personnel and its contractors. The Afghan government condemns these inhumane acts in strong words.”
Reacting to the report from Geneva the UN’s high commissioner in  human rights said there should be no impunity for torture. The report, he added, was a stark reminder that far more should be done to stamp it out. 
In Poland, one of Washington’s closest allies former president acknowledged for the first time the presence of a secret CIA prison there: “The American approached us for (a sight?) he said, we denied knowing what went on inside, but said the sight was closed after pressure from Poland.
Another uncomfortable US ally, Germany the reaction of its foreign minister: “What   was then considered right sand done in the fight against islamist terrorism was unacceptable and a serious mistake”.
Meanwhile Iran’s supreme leader no friend of the United States and whose country is itself often in the human’s right talk tweeted predictably perhaps “The US government is a symbol of tyranny agains humanity.”
And then from Beijing this: “China opposes torture” said its Foreign Ministry spokesman. “We thing the United States should reflect and correct its actions. It should abide by international conventions and regulations”
The CIA and its supporters  plan to fight back against the report’s politicly  charged    conclusions it’s certainly not the last word. The white House has braced itself for more public anger around the world. As Washington still grapples with the continuing legacy of and arguments over what was done in the name of US security.
