The 'disaster' hitting olives and their oil

Olive production is one of the most important business here in Italy and also across southern Europe. But this year, the olive harvests have been a disaster. Here in Italy, trees which would normally produce about 50 kg of olives, this year have produced only 20. There are two main reasons for the disaster this year’s harvests: The Spring and Summer were too wet, there was too much rain, and also this autumn has simply been far too hot, and that has a real impact in all of these trees and growths around me. 

Because the cold autumn usually kills off the olive flies, it means flies can’t attack the trees. This year, because of the sun and the warmth, these flies have attacked the olives and I just want to show you the damage they have caused. Have a look at this: I have just picked it off the ground; it is one olive, which has been damaged by olive flies. You can see the holes that have been made by the fly, and that has made part of this year’ harvests almost completely unusable.

This farm is having to make the most of the olives it’s got. The olive is processed and exported as far away as Japan. The bad harvest force this farm and many more to increase their prices by more than 30%. 
This year eating Italian costs more.
