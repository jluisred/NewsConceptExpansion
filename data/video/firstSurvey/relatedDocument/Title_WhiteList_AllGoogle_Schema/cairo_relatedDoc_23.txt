The clashes came as hundreds of supporters marched on the headquarters of the Republican Guard where Mr Morsi had been staying before taken to an unknown location. Sources claim three people were killed during the protests, however an army spokesman said soldiers only fired blank rounds and teargas. It is unclear if security forces other than the army were present at the clashes. Mr Morsi had been staying at the Guard building before being taken into military custody and placed on house arrest in an unknown location. The crowd of protestors had approached the barbed wire barrier, with some pelting troops with stones. An Associated Press photographer at the scene said that soldiers opened fire on the crowd after protestors had hung a sign of Mr Morsi on the barrier. The violent scenes risk escalating the crisis in Egypt, with Mr Morsi's largely Islamist supporters rejecting the ousting of the country's first freely elected president. The casualties could also fuel calls from some in the Islamist movement for violent retaliation. Several blocks away from the Republican building tens of thousands of supporters of Mr Morsi filled a boulevard outside a mosque. They vowed to remain in place until Mr Morsi is restored, and called the military coup a return of the regime of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, ousted in early 2011. Ismail Abdel-Mohsen, an 18-yar-old student in the crowd, said: The old regime has come back ... worse than before. The military forced Mr Morsi out of office on Wednesday after millions of citizens have taken to the streets during four days of violent protests. The demonstrators had demanded Mr Morsi and his Muslim Brotherhood party step down, saying he had squandered his electoral mandate. The military moved against Mr Morsi after he dismissed a 48 hour deadline set by the military to resolve the political crisis that engulfed Egypt.
