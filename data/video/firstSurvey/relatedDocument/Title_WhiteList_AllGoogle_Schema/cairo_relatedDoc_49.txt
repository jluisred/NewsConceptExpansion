Tensions reached a boiling point in Egypt on Tuesday night, with President Mohamed Morsi and his supporters still holding on tight to his democratic legitimacy while larger opposition forces continue to demand his ouster. For the third day, millions of anti-Morsi demonstrators hit the streets across the nation to demand the removal of Morsi from power. A celebratory atmosphere was obvious most of the day in Cairo's Tahrir Square and at the Qubba and Ittihadeya presidential palaces. Meanwhile, Islamist supporters of Morsi have also carried on their massive sit-in in the vicinity of Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque in Cairo's Nasr City district. Additional thousands have also been gathering at Cairo University in support of the elected president. With pro-Morsi marches in different cities since Monday, more clashes erupted between the two camps. Cairo, Alexandria, Qalioubiya, Giza, Daqahliya, Damietta and Fayoum, among other governorates, have all witnessed violence. Gunfights occurred in Cairo's Kit Kat Square, located in the Imbaba district, with mayhem extending to Nile Street in the nearby Agouza district. Pellets, live fire and Molotov cocktails were also reported during the clashes, while the nearby Bein Al-Sarayat district of Giza witnessed similar fighting. Intermittent clashes also took place near Cairo University, leaving at least 16 dead and 200 injured as of the early hours of Wednesday. Another five were killed during the melee in Giza and over 100 injured, according to a security source who said that three of the victims belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood, the group from which Morsi hails. Apart from rival rallies and clashes, political representatives of both camps refused to back down. The anti-Morsi 'Rebel' signature campaign said it had nominated three of its members to participate in negotiations called for by the armed forces aimed at drawing up a political roadmap for the country. On Monday, the Egyptian Armed Forces gave all parties involved in the ongoing political impasse until Wednesday 17:00 Cairo time to end their differences. ? Should they fail to do so, the armed forces warned that it would issue its own roadmap for Egypt's political future. The Rebel campaign, whose protest calls have been endorsed by most opposition forces, proposed its own roadmap, calling for power to be handed over to the head of Egypt's High Constitutional Court HCC and the formation of a new technocrat government. Meanwhile, the April 6 Youth Movement has endorsed leading opposition figure Mohamed ElBaradei to negotiate on behalf of the opposition. ElBaradei, generally disliked by Morsi supporters, has also been endorsed by the newly-formed 30 June Front, and the leftist Egyptian Popular Current. Morsi, meanwhile, delivered a speech Tuesday night in which he defied opposition calls to step down. Shortly after he called on the army to withdraw its 48-hour ultimatum, President Morsi addressed the nation, saying: Democratic legitimacy is what is preventing bloodshed between the rival camps. We sacrifice for our country and I am the first to sacrifice. If the cost of legitimacy is my life, I will pay it gladly, he said, before renewing his longstanding invitation to all political forces to participate in national dialogue. He also stressed his position as Egypt's first freely elected president, saying he could only be replaced via upcoming polls. In the same speech, Morsi said he was ready to form a new government, reiterating his readiness to make concessions to bring about national reconciliation. These include forming a committee to amend contentious constitutional articles and appointing young Egyptians to important government posts. His offers did little to appease the opposition, however, although they were warmly greeted by his supporters. In response to Morsi's speech, the masses in Tahrir Square and at the Qobba and Ittihadeya presidential palaces chanted loudly, ?Leave, leave,? with demonstrators declaring that sit-ins would continue nationwide until demands for early elections were met. Talking to state television, Khaled Daoud, official spokesperson for the National Salvation Front NSF , Egypt's largest umbrella opposition group, said that the speech was an incitement to civil war as it had only escalated matters more. Ahmed Maher, founder of the April 6 Youth Movement, for his part, said via Twitter: Unfortunately, your [Morsi's] speech came too late. It would have worked months ago, but now you have to resign if you really love Egypt. Conversely, at Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque, where the bulk of Morsi supporters have been gathering, crowds greeted the speech with fireworks and pro-Morsi chants. With our blood and souls, we will defend [the president's democratic] legitimacy, they shouted in unison. Gamal Samak, prominent member of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya?s Building and Development Party, told state television that the president?s speech offered a solution to the crisis, as was requested by the armed forces on Monday. President Morsi, Samak said, had called on all opposition forces to participate in dialogue and offered to form a new government. He urged opposition figures to respond positively to the president's initiative.? Morsi was elected one year ago in Egypt's first-ever free presidential polls. He was fielded in the elections by the Muslim Brotherhood, the group that has staunchly supported him, along with other Islamist parties and groups, most notable of which are Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya and the moderate-Islamist Wasat Party.? DEBKA file: The general acted after Interior Minister Gen. Muhammad Ibrahim offered to place all police, internal security and intelligence forces at the disposal of the army because they no longer defer to the authority of the president or the Muslim Brotherhood government. This virtual ?coup? enabled the army to jump the gun by 24 hours on its ultimatum to Morsi. This military's?action was not quite a ?coup,? but it snatched?away the Muslim Brotherhood government?s buttress of organized security forces, leaving only loyal adherents as a last prop. The army thus jumped the gun by 24 hours on its?ultimatum to the president to ?heed the will of the people? - or else. This move?played out as huge rival demonstrations gathered in Cairo at separate locations with no police in evidence to hold back the sporadic bouts of violence, which are expected to spread. Already,?seven people were killed in three separate violent clashes between supporters and opponents of the Islamist?president. Another huge anti-government took place in Alexandria as well as other Egyptian cities. President Morsi and the Muslim Brothers are hardly likely to lie down for this roadmap out of the crisis, because it would mean relinquishing power after just one year, at the end of decades of being pushed to the fringes of Egypt?s political scene. But there is not much they can do. Their call to turn out and demonstrate for the Islamic flag Tuesday brought out their own followers?and no one else, whereas the opposition is not only backed by millions of assorted groups but has now gained the support?of the army, the police, the security service and the intelligence agency. The crash of Morsi?s presidency would seriously undermine the objectives of the Arab Revolt ?pursued by the Obama administration as the arch-stone of his Middle East policy. The administration had earlier sought unsuccessfully to persuade the heads of the Egyptian army not to issue its?48-hour ultimatum to Egypt?s rulers??heed the will of the people? by Wednesday afternoon - or else the army would intervene. The Americans proposed instead to leave?Morsi in place after stripping him of presidential authority and installing a transitional government to prepare the country for new elections to the presidency and parliament. Obama promised to back steps taken by President Morsi to show he is ?responsive to the opposition?s concerns,? while Gen. Dempsey asked Egyptian generals to moderate their stand against the Muslim Brotherhood. The underlying message was that if they failed to do so, Washington might reconsider its $1.3 billion annual military assistance package which is the main source of income for the armed forces. Heartened by the US president?s vote of support, Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood and its Islamic allies, rejected the army?s ultimatum for resolving the country?s deadly crisis,?saying it would sow confusion and ran contrary to the Egyptian constitution. His regime is meanwhile crumbling:? Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr resigned?early Tuesday, the sixth minister to quit the government in the last 24 hours. He follows the president?s military adviser Gen. Sami Anan, former chief of staff under President Hosni Mubarak. Senior judges and high police officers were seen taking part in the anti-government protest rallies of the last week. Morsi and the Brotherhood now face two ultimatums: If by Tuesday afternoon, he has not agreed to step down and call an early election, the organizers of the protest movement, which has brought millions to the streets of Egyptian cities, will launch a relentless and anarchic campaign of civil disobedience. The defense minister says the army will intervene if the government fails ?to heed the will of the people? by Wednesday afternoon. The Egyptian military estimated that ?millions? of Egyptian demonstrated on Sunday?to demand early presidential elections, only one year into the four-year term of President Muhammad Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood. The nationwide rallies were, the military said, the largest in Egyptian history. The streets leading into Tahrir were so packed that late arrivers could not reach the Square. Tens of thousands of protesters marched from the Square to the Ittihadiya presidential palace, chanting ?The people want the fall of the regime? and chanting?against the Muslim Brotherhood?from which the president hails, calling for the fall of the rule of the Supreme Guide Muhammad Badi` is the head of the Brotherhood, and they were accusing Morsi of being his puppet . A?slide show of images is here. Demonstrations were also held in provincial towns and cities all over the country, including Alexandria,?Minufiya, Kafr Sheikh, Asyut, Ismailia, Port Said, and many others. For the most part, Sunday?s rallies were peaceful, amazingly so given the millions involved. But there were a few exceptions, and at least 5 people died in violence. In?Port Said?a bomb appears to have gone off, killing a journalist and wounding dozens, but it did not deter a massive crowd from gathering at Martyrs Square. In Asyut a clash occurred between pro- and anti-Mursi crowds that left 4 dead and dozens wounded. Activists in Ismailia on Twitter declared the city a Muslim Brotherhood free zone. Muslim Brotherhood centers were attacked or burned in some provincial towns. In the Muqattam Hills above Cairo, thugs set fire to the HQ of the Freedom and Justice Party of the Muslim Brotherhood. The activists had not called for protests in Muqattam, so this criminal act issued from other quarters, very possibly from Mubarak supporters still sore about the supplanting of his party by the Brotherhood. Much of the protest is economic. Morsi?s government has pursued austerity policies and it has failed to revive tourism or attract substantial productive investment. Egypt?s foreign currency reserves have been cut in half, causing the Egyptian pound to fall in value, and hurting Egyptians, who depend on imported food and fuel. The?textile workers of al-Mahalla al-Kubra,?whose 2006-2008 strikes were a rallying cry for anti-Mubarak activists, have warned that under Morsi their factories are threatened with closure altogether. Although some of the animus against Morsi comes from liberals and secularists annoyed by his religious fundamentalism, many of the protesters on Sunday were devout Muslims who just object to Morsi?s high-handed style of governing, failed economic policies, and favoritism toward his Muslim Brotherhood base. One banner in Tahrir said, ?we are for Islam, against the Muslim Brotherhood.? The army estimated that 20,000 supporters demonstrated for Morsi in the square in front of the Rabi?a al-`Adawiya Mosque in Nasr City, about 5 km from the Ittihadiya Presidential Palace. The ministry of interior spokesman, a Muslim Brotherhood supporter, gave out completely fantastic estimates of 17 million in the streets throughout the country, the vast majority of them supporting the president. It claimed 4 million at Nasr City, which is quite impossible. As far as I can tell from various reports both in Cairo and the provinces, this allegation is ridiculous on the face of it. The anti-Morsi demonstrations were called for by?the Rebellion or Tamarrud movement, founded on April 28 and launched on May Day by youth disillusioned with Morsi, some of whom had voted for him, including Mahmoud Badr. Some of the Rebellion activists?came out of the youth wing Youth for Change of the Kefaya? Enough! movement founded to protest the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak in 2004. The Rebellion Movement deployed two protest tactics. One was the gathering of signatures on a petition asking Morsi to step down. I was in Egypt in early June and found these petitions were everywhere, and I was handed them more than once myself. Rebellion sought to gather 15 million signatures, since Morsi had won the presidency last year with about 13 million votes to 12 million votes for his rival, Ahmad Shafiq. They figured 15 million signatures against him would demonstrate that he had lost his popular mandate. In the event, Badr?says that Rebellion was able to gather 22 million signatures?to its petition asking for early presidential elections. Morsi was elected to a 4-year term in June, 2012 but Rebellion wants him to step down and to hold new elections immediately . The second tactic was to call for massive rallies and sit-ins beginning June 30, the anniversary of Morsi?s election, which they envisage continuing until Morsi meets their demand. That is,the millions in the street on Sunday were not gathered, as some Muslim Brotherhood officials alleged, for ?just one day.? Rebellion gave Morsi until Tuesday to step down, and if he doesn?t, they plan further huge rallies, including on Tuesday and then Friday. There is no provision in either the 1971 or the 2012 Egyptian constitution for the president to be recalled, so the demands of the youth are technically unconstitutional. But from their point of view, Morsi?s behavior last fall, in putting himself above the law and pushing through a controversial constitution with some fundamentalist implications, were crimes of a Nixonian sort, and so they are demanding he resign rather as Americans demanded that Tricky Dick resign,in 1975. In contrast to Nixon, however, Morsi?s support has not collapsed and he isn?t in danger of being impeached there is no elected parliament at the moment . The only part of the elite that could force him out of office is the army, and a military coup could not possibly be good for Egyptian democracy. Ironically, from February 2011 through August of 2012, the main demand of the activist youth was that the army return to its barracks. To be fair, the youth are not demanding army intervention, they are demanding a kind of California-style recall of the executive and early elections.
