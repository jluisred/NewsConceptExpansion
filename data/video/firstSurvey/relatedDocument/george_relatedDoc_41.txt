East, of Jockey Club Racecourses, said: ?Newmarket Racecourses, like the rest of the country, was thrilled with the birth of baby George to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Around half an hour after the visit from the Queen, William, Kate and their baby were seen being driven away from Kensington Palace. The Queen has arrived at Kensington Palace to visit the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, ahead of her stay at Balmoral. It is the first time the Queen has seen her great-grandson since his birth on Monday.
