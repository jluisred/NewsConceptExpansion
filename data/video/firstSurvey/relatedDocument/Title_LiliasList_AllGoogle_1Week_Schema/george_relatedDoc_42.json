When he will be King the boy is third in line to the throne , he will be known as King George VII. Until then though, the boy will be called His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, the Daily Mail reports. George was a favorite with bookies since the Duchess announced she was expecting, so it wasn?t that much of a surprise that they opted for it. Even though George is a common name with the British royalty, palace sources say for the tab that Kate and William chose all the names ?because they liked them ? no more no less.? ?The Mail understands that William and Kate had already decided by the time they introduced the Queen to her heir ? and third great-grandchild ? at Kensington Palace yesterday morning,? the tab further says. ?There is no royal protocol which dictates the sovereign must be given approval, but it is believed the couple discussed their choice with her during their 30-minute meeting. They then told other members of their immediate family before making the news public,? adds the same media outlet. Yesterday morning, the Duchess and her son left the hospital, but not before they took part in a brief photo session and answered a few questions from the media. The Duke, as expected, was with them, also taking part in the interview. Both parents talked of the happiness they felt when they got to hold their child in their arms for the first time, and William even joked that he would remind him of his ?tardiness? when he grew up. After a few minutes, they left for home with Prince William behind the wheel.
