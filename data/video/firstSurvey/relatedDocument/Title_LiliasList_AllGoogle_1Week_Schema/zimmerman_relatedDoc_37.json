The ?not guilty? verdict of George Zimmerman for the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin immediately sparked protests across the nation. Bill O?Reilly commented on the reaction in tonight?s Talking Points Memo. 	?There are two groups of people exploiting the Zimmerman verdict. The first are folks who simply hate America. [?] The anti-American folks are using the acquittal of George Zimmerman to vent their hatred,? O?Reilly said. ?Talking Points believes that?s dishonest. In general, America had nothing to do with the death of Trayvon Martin. It was a calamity, not a product of policy.? 	The Factor host pointed to the example of Father Michael Pfleger, a pastor at Saint Sabina Church in Chicago, who gave a fiery sermon the day after the acquittal. He said, ?I refuse to ignore the race in this issue. We are not in a post-racial era. In fact, racism has a second breath in America today, and last night, it got new oxygen.? 	The second group of people who are emotionally invested in the demise of Zimmerman are those who truly believe the country is racist, O?Reilly assessed. ?Many of these Americans are nursing personal grievances. Others are victims of the victim mentality.? 	He said that Talking Points understands the anger toward Zimmerman, given that he went after Martin based on the way he looked and for initiating the confrontation. ?But you don?t convict someone of murder because he shows poor judgment or because he racially profiles,? he added. 	O?Reilly concluded that to believe the verdict was racially motivated, then??you have to believe that six women jurors want to harm blacks. [?] You simply cannot brand a jury racist without visible proof.?
