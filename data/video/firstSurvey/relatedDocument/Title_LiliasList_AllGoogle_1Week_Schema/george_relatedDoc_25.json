We have a name for Prince William and Kate Middleton's newborn prince! The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge, Clarence House tweeted today, and the full name is George Alexander Louis. The baby shares one name with his father, Prince William, whose full name is William Arthur Philip Louis. George is an important name in the Windsor family, as it was the name of Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI, and grandfather King George V. It was also the favorite among bet makers. When he ascends to the throne one day, the newest British royal will presumably be King George VII. 9 Rules for Prince Harry, Prince William and Princess Kate to Follow Now That They're on Twitter 10 hours ago The Most Hilarious Things People Are Tweeting to Prince William and Kate 13 hours ago You Can Officially Follow Will, Kate, and Harry on Twitter! 16 hours ago Scandals That Will Change the Way You Think About the Royals 1 week ago Look Back at the Year in British Royals 2 weeks ago Will and Kate's Cutest Snaps of the Year 2 weeks ago Will and Kate Have a Very Merry Christmas With Their Families 2 weeks ago What Fabulous Gifts Did Prince George Receive in 2014? 12 hours ago Look Back at the Year in British Royals 2 weeks ago Prince George's 14 Most Adorable Moments From 2014 3 weeks ago All the Times Prince George Was Unimpressed 3 weeks ago Prince George Couldn't Be Cuter in His New Holiday Pictures 12/15/14 Royal Report: Inside Kate and William's Babymoon ??With George! 11/05/14 Trendy Halloween Costumes Inspired by This Year's Biggest Stories 10/30/14 Kate Middleton, Prince William Join Royal Family for Sandringham Christmas Service: Where Were Prince George and Camilla? 2 weeks ago Kate Middleton's Crowning Maternity Style Moments 12/04/14 Kate Middleton's Maternity Style Moments Just Keep Getting Better 11/10/14 How Does Kate's Current Pregnancy Stack Up Against Her First One? 10/21/14 Everything You Need to Know About the New Royal Baby 10/20/14 When Is the Second Royal Baby Due? 10/20/14 Pregnant Celebrities' 128 Best Maternity Looks 10/17/14 Kate Middleton, Prince William, Prince Harry Get Royal Twitter Account, Share New Photos 15 hours ago The Most Hilarious Things People Are Tweeting to Prince William and Kate 13 hours ago You Can Officially Follow Will, Kate, and Harry on Twitter! 16 hours ago Pregnant Kate Middleton Kicks Off Her Busy Week With a Shopping Spree 20 hours ago Kate Middleton's Top 13 Un-Princess-y Beauty Moments 5 days ago All the Times Kate Middleton Looked Like a True Princess 5 days ago 18 Times the Queen Wouldn't Have Approved of Kate Middleton's Outfit 5 days ago Prince Harry Meets with NBA Star Carmelo Anthony to Support Sports Mentorship Program 8 hours ago You Can Officially Follow Will, Kate, and Harry on Twitter! 16 hours ago Pregnant Kate Middleton Kicks Off Her Busy Week With a Shopping Spree 20 hours ago Kate Middleton's Top 13 Un-Princess-y Beauty Moments 5 days ago All the Times Kate Middleton Looked Like a True Princess 5 days ago A Guide to Kate Middleton's Least Princess-y Facial Expressions 5 days ago Kate Middleton's Not Too Princess-y to Play Sports 6 days ago
