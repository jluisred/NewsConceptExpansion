As we previously informed you, the jury found that the 2012 fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, was an act of self-defense. Los Angeles Clippers forward Matt Barnes declares his frustration to USA Today, mentioning that Zimmerman had no right to shoot the unarmed teen, attempted robbery or not. The streets aren't always safe. Whether Zimmerman got beat up or not, the point is, he was supposed to be in the car and let the police handle it. He didn't do that and a 17-year-old kid is dead because of that, Barnes says. He was joined in the sentiment by Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade. He mentions that he feels for the victim's family, being a father himself. Wow!!! Stunned!!! Saddened as a father!!! Some1 make sense of this verdict for me right now please!!! Don't worry I'll wait, he tweets. NFL linebacker Scott Fujita also used Twitter to criticize the legal process that let go of Martin's shooter. Who really failed here? The prosecution? The jury? No. The laws in the state of FL failed. Be constructive in response. Focus on change, he argues. Los Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford adds that the system has not changed, hinting to allegations of racial profiling by Zimmerman. The more things change, the more they stay the same. #RipTrayvonMartin, he posts. American justice system is a joke, Oklahoma City Thunder center Kendrick Perkins writes. Several players on the Miami Heat have been very vocal in making their views on the case public. #WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice, LeBron James wrote in the caption to a photo including a number players in hoodies.
