Consider the set structure of the users who participated in the discussion of the p rince 's name . To identify the communities that were formed dynamically in the discussion under analysis, we used a fast greedy modularity optimization algorithm. To build a graph , we used a Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm . This algorithm belongs to force algorithms , or spring algorithms . The character of the graph is due to the model which is used in force algorithms. The distinctive feature of the model is that it s vertices are considered as the balls , affected by repulsive forces ; and the edges are considered as ?spring models that attract the vertices which are connected by these edges . In the tweet arrays, we have found 6919 users that sent 37191 tweets. These tweets mentioned 2645 users. A n essential part of these mentions is relates to retweets. For further analysis, we take active users who sent more than on tweet in the process of discussion or who were mentioned in tweets more than once . We have found 2,300 a ctive users who sent more than one tweet , and 923 users who were mentioned in tweets more than once. F igure 6 shows the graph of users' interr elations , the shades of colors on it mark the users' communities. On th is graph , we can see that there are several numerous user s' communities.
