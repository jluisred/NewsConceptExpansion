CAIRO ? Egypt's Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, has repeated his vow to stay in office. His statement came just before a deadline set by the country's military. It has told Morsi to respond to the demands of the millions of people who've taken to the streets, calling for him to step down. In his last-minute statement before the deadline, Morsi again rejected the involvement of the military, and criticized the armed forces for taking only one side. He said the only way to prevent violence would be to accept his electoral legitimacy.
