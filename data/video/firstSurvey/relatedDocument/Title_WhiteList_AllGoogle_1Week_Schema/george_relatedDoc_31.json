We all?met Kate Middleton and Prince William?s royal baby boy?yesterday, but while he was the cutest little button we ever saw, we still couldn?t put a name to his pudgy face. It?s not like we had already forgotten, it?s that he hadn?t yet been given a name. MORE:?Click here for the latest news and developments on the royal baby!? According to Richard Fitzwilliams, Royal Commentator, Prince Charles? name wasn?t announced for an entire month after his birth and Princess Diana took a month to announce Prince William?s moniker. Yet the public only had to wait a day for Harry's name, so we weren't sure when to expect the big baby name reveal. Upon leaving the hospital on Tuesday, Prince William said they were still working on a name, but it seems it didn't take the Duke and Duchess all that long! To be honest, we're a little bummed that they didn't choose to include Spencer, Diana's surname, in George's name. According to the betting pool, Spencer had been in a tie at 8th place whereas George was holding fast at #1. But either way, we think the name fits this little prince very well! Welcome, baby George!
