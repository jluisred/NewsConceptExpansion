US fugitive Edward Snowden has made a public statement to the media at Moscow Airport. The former US government contractor met with members of activist group Human Rights Watch, who later transmitted an audio message from him to a huge crowd of journalists. ?I did not seek to enrich myself,? Snowden said. ?I did not seek to sell U.S. secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. ? I ask for your assistance in requesting guarantees of safe passage from the relevant nations in securing my passage to Latin America as well as requesting asylum in Russia until such time as these states accede to law, and my legal travel is permitted.? Snowden is on the run from the US government, after leaking secret details of their spying program. Though he intends to apply for asylum in Russia, the country?s President Vladimir Putin has said Snowden must agree to stop leaking US intelligence secrets to be considered for asylum.
