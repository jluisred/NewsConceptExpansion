The world?s most famous infant finally has a name: the little prince will be called George Alexander Louis, His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge,?Clarence House revealed on Wednesday. There have been six kings with the name of George, which was a favourite of British bookmakers in the run-up to the announcement,?but none named Alexander or Louis. Queen Elizabeth II?s full name is?Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; Prince William?s?William Arthur Philip Louis Windsor. The name raises speculation that if he were to become king the new prince would choose the title George VII, but there is no guarantee that as monarch he would use his first name. His great-great-grandfather, George VI, the Queen?s father, was christened Albert Frederick Arthur George and used his fourth name when he came to the throne, although he was known by his family as Bertie George VI is also the monarch portrayed by Colin Firth in the film The King?s Speech. The name Louis could be a tribute to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh?s uncle and the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947. William?s father, Prince Charles, was close with Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army in 1979. The name Louis has also left broadcasters asking Kensington Palace??is it ?Lou-ee? or ?Lou-iss?'? For the record, it?s Lou-ee, in the French style. Alexander was said to be a favourite of Kate?s,?according to the BBC, which also reported?the Duchess had told someone they had a shortlist of names?during the pregnancy,?but friends also texted the couple with their own suggestions. The announcement from Prince William and Kate ? just two days after the baby?s birth ? was quick, by royal standards. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh took a month before settling on the name Charles for the Prince of Wales. Diana, Princess of Wales, and Prince Charles took a week before settling on William?s four names. In 2012, George was the sixth most popular baby name for boys in the U.K., according to Babycentre.co.uk, but dropped to ninth in the first half of 2013.?Alexander was 26th in 2012, and Louis didn?t make the list although Louie edged in at 94th . Now that Kate and William have chosen a name, they are expected to soon choose a photographer for the baby?s first official portrait. The moniker evokes the steadfastness of the Queen?s father,?George VI, who rallied the nation during the Second World War. Meaning farmer or earth worker, George also honours St. George, a 4th-century Christian martyr and the patron saint of England. The announcement comes as palace officials say Prince William and his wife Kate are spending ?private and quiet time for them to get to know their son? ? and, perhaps, to figure out ways to shield him from intense public and media interest. At least the relationship got off to a good start. The baby slept through his first photo op outside London?s St. Mary?s Hospital, while his parents beamed as they chatted easily with reporters. For a Royal Family that has had a fraught relationship with the media, it was a positive sign. ?I thought, is this an Oscar-winning performance?? said Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine. ?But I think they were so genuinely overjoyed that they wanted to show off the baby.? After leaving the hospital, the couple introduced their son to his uncle, Prince Harry, and to his great-grandmother, the Queen, keen to see the baby before she starts her annual summer vacation in Scotland later this week. Then they headed to see Kate?s parents in their village near London ? pretty much like any regular family. There has been so much royal drama in the last few decades that it?s easy to forget that William had, by royal standards, a relatively normal childhood. His parents? troubled marriage may have ended in divorce, but Prince Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, were devoted parents who tried to spend as much time as possible with their children ? albeit with an assist from nannies. The Queen was sometimes away on official tours for months at a time when her children were young, but Charles and Diana took William along on a tour to Australia when he was just nine months old. The Queen was educated at home, in keeping with royal tradition. But she sent her own children to boarding schools, and Charles and Diana did the same with William and his younger brother Harry ? choosing Eton, one of the biggest and most prestigious boys? schools in the country. ?William?s childhood was normal by upper-middle-class standards? private schools, expensive holidays, McDonald?s in a smart part of town as opposed to a grotty part of town,? said royal historian Robert Lacey. ?I think really one is going to see more of the same.? Lacey thinks Kate?s middle-class background will also help ensure her son gets a broader world view than some of his royal predecessors. The baby?s maternal grandparents, Carole and Michael Middleton, are self-made millionaires who run a party-planning business from the village of Bucklebury, west of London. ?From Buckingham Palace to Bucklebury ? these are the two elements that will be in this child?s upbringing,? Lacey said. Lacey noted that on Kate?s side the baby prince had ?a grandfather who started off dispatching aircraft from Heathrow Airport and a grandmother who started out as a flight attendant and grew up on a council estate, who came from coal-mining stock in Durham in northern England . That is all funneling through.? Historian Antonia Fraser noted on BBC radio that the Middletons also provide an example of marital stability ??unlike so many royal marriages recently.? William?s childhood normality was possible because the palace struck a deal with the media ? privacy in exchange for a number of agreed photo opportunities at birthdays and during school holidays. Seward said Kate and William would try to arrange a similar deal for their son. ?When they have got time to think, they will have to do some kind of deal with the press,? she said. ?In return for some really beautiful photographs, they will be left alone.? The British press adhered to the agreement while William and Harry were children. But once they reached adulthood, all bets were off. Photos soon appeared of Prince Harry on drunken nights out, or wearing a Nazi outfit to a costume party. Tabloid reporters were also secretly hacking the mobile phone voicemails of royal aides in quest of scoops. The revelation of the scale of that illegal eavesdropping ? on celebrities, politicians and crime victims as well as the royals ? horrified the British public and chastened the rambunctious press, although that may be a temporary state of affairs. Palace officials still have some sway over newspaper editors. When they complained about photos of William and Kate walking on a beach near their home in Wales, British newspapers did not run them. But the foreign press is impossible to control, as the palace learned when an Italian magazine ran topless pictures of Kate taken during a holiday in France. But, Lacey points out, the media can cut both ways. This baby will be the first future monarch to grow up in the era of Twitter, Facebook and other social media. ?That will give him an incredible insight into how the country and population he is supposed to represent live and breathe and enjoy themselves and corrupt each other,? he said. ?In the Middle Ages we have legends of idealistic princes who would dress in ordinary clothes and go out into the streets of town after dark to see how their subjects lived. The electronic media, for all their hazards, do offer this new dimension to an heir.? With files from Bloomberg
