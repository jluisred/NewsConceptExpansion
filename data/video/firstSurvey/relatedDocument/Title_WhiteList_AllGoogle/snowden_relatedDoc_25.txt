Russia has not received an asylum application from fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden, officials said today. The former US National Security Agency worker has been stranded at Moscow?s Sheremetyevo international airport since June 23. He had arrived from Hong Kong, apparently intending to board a flight to Cuba, but has spent the last three weeks marooned in the airport?s transit zone. On Friday, he met there with human rights activists and said he would seek Russian asylum as a temporary measure before going to Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua, all of which have offered him asylum. But the Russian migration service said today that no asylum request had been received. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that under Russian law, asylum seekers must first make an official appeal to the Federal Migration Service. He added: ?We are not in contact with Snowden.? The remarks suggested Russia is weighing its options after Snowden broke his silence and asked for refuge in Russia until he can secure safe passage to Latin America. Washington urged Moscow to return Snowden to the US, where he is wanted on espionage charges after revealing details of secret surveillance programmes, and President Obama spoke by phone with Russia?s President Putin. The White House criticised Russia for allowing Snowden to meet human rights activists, calling it a ?propaganda platform?. Snowden has asked 20 countries for asylum and received offers from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia. But he said yesterday that Western states had made it ?impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there?. Snowden has left behind ballerina girlfriend Lindsay Mills.
