A Korean website has published pictures of flowers, vegetables and fruit covered with deformities and lumps. But it is not immediately clear where the produce was farmed from, whether the images have been doctored and whether the nuclear disaster is in fact to blame. A report in October last year found radiation levels in most kinds of fish caught off the coast of Fukushima haven't declined in the year following Japan's nuclear disaster in March 2011. An earthquake knocked out nuclear plant's cooling system, causing three reactor cores to melt and spew radiation into the ocean. Researchers believe that deposits of the chemical cesium on the seafloor or leakage from the damaged reactors is continuing to contaminate the waters - and has the potential to threaten fisheries for decades. The levels in the fish are also 10 times higher than the radiation measured last August in scorpion fish caught near Fukushima.
