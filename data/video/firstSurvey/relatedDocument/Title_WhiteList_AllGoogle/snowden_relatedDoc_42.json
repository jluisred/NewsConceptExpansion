MOSCOW, July 23 RIA Novosti - Fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has become the winner of this year?s Whistleblower Award established by German human rights organizations, the German branch of Transparency International said in a statement. ?This year?s winner of the Whistleblower Award is Edward Snowden,? the statement posted on TI Germany website on Monday said. The award, established in 1999, is sponsored by the Association of German Scientists VDW and the German branch of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms IALANA . A VDW spokesperson told RIA Novosti on Monday that the award money, amounting to 3,000 euros, would be passed to Snowden through his representatives ? either a lawyer or a ?friendly? organization. Snowden, who faces prosecution in the United States for leaking highly sensitive classified data about the US National Security Agency's surveillance activities, submitted a request for temporary asylum in Russia last week, having been holed up in the transit zone of a Moscow airport since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. He is still waiting for a decision by the Russian migration authorities. Washington has repeatedly called on Moscow to reject Snowden?s request for asylum and send him back to the United States to stand trial on charges of espionage and theft.
