Leaders of Denver's African-American community will hold a demonstration to protest the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed Trayvon Martin, Sunday. This is a situation where our community doesn't want to sit quiet and be still in the face of this situation, said Brother Jeff Fard, founder of Brother Jeff's Cultural Center in the Five Points neighborhood. A jury on Saturday found the former neighborhood watch leader not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. Zimmerman, said he shot in self-defense after the unarmed Martin, 17, attacked him. We are not privy to everything the jury discussed but in our gut we know had the situation been reversed and Trayvon killed Zimmerman, he would not have been treated the same as Zimmerman. I am pretty sure he would have been convicted by now, said Fard. The acquittal has sparked protest in other cities throughout the country. The demonstration, held to show support for Martin's family, will be held in City Park at 2 p.m., Fard said. I don't advocate any sorts of violence but I do think there are some things that can be done. There will be a civil suit. The Colorado community can come together to raise funds to ease the financial burden on the family. Tom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee
