Clearly, Prince William and Kate watch Seinfeld reruns. There is no other explanation for a royal baby being named George Alexander Louis. You can tell me all you want that George and Louis are names fit for a king. Yada, yada, yada. This royal baby name is all about the other George. George Costanza. You have your George obvious . And then you have your Alexander As in Jason, the actor who plays George . And you finish it with Louis, which some people have compared to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but I don?t think that?s correct. George Costanza?s middle name was Louis. Once again, there?s a fitting quote here. ?Jerry, just remember, it?s not a lie if you believe it.? All that said, here are five more quotes from the original George that could be applicable to Prince George: ?You know I always wanted to pretend I was an architect.? ? some day, Prince George will need a way to impress a woman. This will be gold, Jerry. Gold! ?I?m speechless. I have no speech.? ? When Prince George sees the media coverage of his birth in a few years, this is what he will say. ?I want to make a good entrance. I never make good entrances.? ? no doubt, a baby destined to be a Seinfeld baby was thinking this on the way out, errrr in. ?Hi, my name is George, I?m unemployed and I live with my parents.? ? OK, pretty sure he won?t have to go to this one. ?Mulva!? ? only because it has to sound even funnier in a British accent. And there you have it. Further proof that George Alexander Louis is a Seinfeld baby. Don?t let the Brits tell you otherwise. ?I would drape myself in velvet if it were socially acceptable.? It is. You?re a royal. Drape away, little Costanza. Drape away.
