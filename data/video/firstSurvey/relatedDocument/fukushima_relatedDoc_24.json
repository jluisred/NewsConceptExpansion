Even though the high cesium readings are coming from groundwater nearby the battered Fukushima plant, the Tokyo Electric Power company is refusing to comment on the origins of the high cesium-134 levels and this has many up in arms, criticizing TEPCO. A Japan nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear Regulation Authority, has condemned the Tokyo Electric Power company for not coming out and warning the public of the origins of the high cesium levels. It's even more interesting to note that the TEPCO Company has admitted in the past month that recent soil samples at the Fukushima plant are showing up with other high level readings of cesium-137, tritium, and strontium-90. Substances like these were released and are increasing in incidence due to the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdowns that followed the March 2011 tsunami which swamped the plant and shut down the cooling systems. Now the cesium levels are at their all-time highest since the March 2011 breakdown. At the time of the meltdown, tens of thousands of people were forced from their homes to avoid the toxic radiation onslaught from the planet's worst nuclear accident in the last generation. The meltdown furthered the tragedy of the earthquake and tsunami that claimed over 18,000 lives in Japan. A TEPCO official told the Japanese media. It is unclear whether the radioactive water is leaking into the sea. After gathering needed data, we will conduct analyses. I see TEPCO has not been able to find the cause of these spikes in readings, Nuclear Regulation Authority Chairman Shunichi Tanaka said at a meeting among commissioners. TEPCO says there has not been meaningful impact on the environment. But we must see for sure what are the possibilities of this leading to oceanic contamination, Commissioner Toyoshi Fuketa, said.
