24 JULY 2013 												 						 						 						The Queen has said she is thrilled to welcome her first great-grandson, and two days after Prince William and Kate Middleton's new baby son Prince?George was born, the reigning monarch finally got the chance to meet the latest addition to the British royal family. Queen Elizabeth II was spotted being driven into the grounds of Kensington Palace on Wednesday morning, in a green Bentley car, and was clearly excited to welcome Baby Cambridge. She looked elegant wearing a summery turquoise dress and pearls, and gave a broad smile as she was whisked through the palace gates. The 87-year old monarch paid a brief visit to the family, spending about half an hour with them, and it is likely that the topic of baby names was discussed. George, James and Alexander have largely been tipped as popular choices?by the bookies, but Prince William and Kate said on Tuesday night that they were still working on a name. We've still got to decide on a name, William told reporters, as the family left the hospital. We'll let you know as soon as we can. After staying at the private Lindo Wing for the baby's first night, Prince William and Kate delighted crowds when they presented their son to the world. The little Prince slept blissfully in his parents' arms as Prince William and Kate answered questions about the new arrival. William joked that his son has a good pair of lungs on him, and looked full of pride as he held the newborn in his arms. Kate revealed that William had changed?the first nappy, while her husband quipped that their baby had way more hair than me. The Queen was informed of the baby's birth by telephone when Prince William called from the hospital, but had not had a chance to visit Baby Cambridge due to previous engagements at Buckingham Palace.
