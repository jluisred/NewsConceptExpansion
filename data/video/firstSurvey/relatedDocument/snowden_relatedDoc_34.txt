Russian attorney Anatoly Kucherena ? who also happens to be the head of public council for the Federal Security Service FSB ? has announced that Edward Snowden may leave the Moscow airport on Wednesday. That's right, he's likely not going too far. We also know?that Snowden supposedly said he has no plans to travel to Latin America because at this time, he thought it too dangerous to travel. How do we know that? Well, Kucherena said Snowden said it, of course. Not only does Kucherena run the FSB's public council, but it seems he runs Snowdens public relations as well ? he helped Snowden apply for temporary asylum, he relayed Snowden's promise not to hurt the U.S. anymore, and?he announced Snowden's very own idea about possibly applying for Russian citizenship with the intent to stay for a while and learn Russian culture. In the meantime, President Vladimir Putin says Snowden's snafu?is all America's fault. Then he reiterates that Russia can't wait to be rid of the guy who knows the comprehensive ins and outs of America's National Security Agency ? what the Soviet KGB used to call Omega to indicate its importance in foreign espionage operations. In short, intelligence expert and freelance reporter Joshua Foust may be right: the FSB speaks for Snowden now in what looks like? a sophisticated intelligence operation against the United States.
