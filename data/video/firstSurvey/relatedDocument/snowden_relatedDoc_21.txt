Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed the Americans for ensuring whistleblower Edward Snowden remaines stranded in Russia. Speaking after an underwater dive in the Gulf of Finland Putin said the US had ?spooked? other countries into refusing Snowden entry. He added he saw signs the former US spy contractor was stopping any political activity directed against the USA, but for the moment the situation remained unresolved. ?He arrived on our territory without an invitation ? we didn?t invite him. And he was not flying to us. He was flying in transit to other countries. But as soon as he got in the air it became known, and our American partners, actually, blocked his further flight. They themselves scared other countries,? he said. Russia refuses to hand him over, and for now Snowden is a stateless refugee, holed up in a corner of Moscow airport, neither in Russia officially, or anywhere else. Several nations are possible asylum destinations, notably Ecuador. 2 What will you ask US Senator John McCain? | euronews, world news 3 Watch: Passengers ?push-start? frozen plane in Siberia | euronews, world news 5 Which countries in Europe cause the most air pollution damage? | euronews, world news 10 Grenoble: Europe?s first ad-free city | euronews, world news 11 Crude awakening: Romania?s Black Sea oil and gas finds fuel Europe?s energy hopes | euronews, reporter
