WSJ:? Radiation of 750 million becquerels a liter of cesium-134 and 1.6 billion becquerels a liter of cesium-137 was recorded, Tepco said. The normal limits for the two potentially harmful isotopes are 60 and 90 becquerels, respectively. In April 2011 a combined 1.8 billion becquerels was recorded. 'The level of radioactivity is potentially serious but the impact would depend on where it is found,' a Tepco official said. The sample came from a trench near the No. 2 reactor turbine building, the utility said. Water with much lower radiation?around 9,000-18,000 becquerels a liter--has leaked into the sea from groundwater, Tepco said earlier this week after the Nuclear Regulation Authority said it suspected seepage. This radiation was at 'far lower levels' than found in the trench samples, the Tepco official said. Tepco is searching for the water source. It is probably from one of the damaged reactor cores. It is trying to stop the water leaking into the sea, it said. ? EXSKF: 5,000 cubic meters, or 5,000 tonnes of this water is in the trench. Note: 5,000 cubic meters of water is equal to 5 million liters. One liter was found to contain 2.35 billion becquerels of cesium. If this concentration is consistent, the total amount would be nearly 12 quadrillion becquerels of cesium in this one trench. Japan Times hat tip: ENE : Tokyo Electric Power Co. said Saturday that the trench problem at the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant has cropped up again and is sending highly radioactive water into the sea. The water in the underground passage, which runs under the turbine building of reactor 2, contains 2.35 billion becquerels of cesium per liter, roughly the same as that measured right after the crisis began in spring 2011. The latest sample, taken Friday from a trench, contained 750 million becquerels of cesium-134, 1.6 billion becquerels of cesium-137 and 750 million becquerels of other radioactive substances, the utility said. A sample from April 2011 contained 1.8 billion becquerels of both cesium-134 and cesium-137 per liter. Cesium has a half-life of about 30 years. The trench is believed to be the source of the groundwater problem that?s been baffling Tepco?s experts for months. Their current theory is that the highly radioactive water found and left in the trench in 2011 is now leaking directly into the groundwater, which is seeping into the sea.Tepco finally admitted Monday that contaminated water was getting into the Pacific. The admission came after the Nuclear Regulation Authority pointed out that highly radioactive water was 'strongly suspected' to be seeping into the ground under the site and making its way to the sea. ? Asahi Shimbun: According to TEPCO, 2.35 billion becquerels of radioactive cesium were detected per liter of water that was sampled July 26 from a cable pit on the ocean side of the No. 2 reactor. The breakdown was 750 million becquerels of cesium-134 and 1.6 billion becquerels of cesium-137. A liter of the water was also found to contain 750 million becquerels of radioactive substances that emit beta rays, such as strontium. Those concentration levels are almost the same as measurements taken during the early phases of the disaster, TEPCO said. 'We believe the highly radioactive water is staying within the pit,' a TEPCO official said, adding that the utility will nevertheless check carefully for possible leaks into surrounding soil and seal the ground to block such leaks from reaching the sea. ... The utility hopes to halt the problem by building a wall out of liquid glass between the reactors and the sea and removing the contaminated water from the underground passage. 3D Printing 9 60s Legacies 14 A.I. 41 Afterlife 113 Alan Moore 25 Albert Einstein 21 Alchemy 8 Algernon Blackwood 1 Aliens 60 Angela Carter 1 Animals 90 Anniversaries 67 Anthropology 8 Antimatter 7 Antiquarians 5 Apocalypse 122 Archaeology 66 Architecture 32 Aristotle 8 Ars Amatoria 17 Ars Politica 12 Art Nouveau 3 Arthur C.
