Dr. Drew Pinsky perhaps took the biggest fall from grace of any HLN anchor. An outspoken Republican and supporter of Dick Cheney and Mitt Romney, he must look down upon JVM. A Californian and the son of Russian immigrants, Pinsy attended USC, Pinhead had a modicum of respect when he stuck to his specialty of addiction medicine. Like most HLN sociopaths, this wasn?t good enough to fulfill his massive ego. Pinsky started off on radio in 1984, and hasn?t looked back since. He co-hosted Loveline, and spent time as an actor before starting his Celebrity Rehab. Pinsky originally joined HLN to have a show on addiction. This has somehow morphed into a show on high-profile legal cases. Pinsky only shows one side to every story, and it?s always the prosecution?s side. His conservative ties led him to his favorite guest, Katie Wick, of The Conservative Cut, as well as Jenny Hutt and Janine ?the fraud? Driver. Because many don?t know about his egotistical white-collar criminal past, some take him seriously. Occupy knows better than to take this egoist seriously. That?s why he?s got a permanent spot on the Wall of Shame.
