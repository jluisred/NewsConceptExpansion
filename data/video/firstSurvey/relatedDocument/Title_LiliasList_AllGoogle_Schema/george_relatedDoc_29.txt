There is a new prince in town and his name is George Alexander Louis, and his official title is His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. The announcement comes a day after The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge left the hospital to worldwide celebrations. The naming of the newborn happened just two days after he was born, which was much more speedier than his ancestors. It took a week for William's name to be revealed, and a month for his father's father, Prince Charles, to be announced.
