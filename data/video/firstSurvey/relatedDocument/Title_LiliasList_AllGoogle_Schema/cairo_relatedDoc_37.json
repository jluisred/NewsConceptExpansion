The sides are set with both vowing not to back down. The army has clearly taken note of the large demonstrations on Sunday and feels the people are behind them wanting Morsi to step down. The plan they announced yesterday, should they have to depose Morsi, would be almost exactly the way Mubarak ran the country which kept the peace for 20 years, but also was very severe on fundamentalist Islam . Morsi feels his election and the support of those around him will be enough to hold the line. We are going to find out later today if the empasse and the deadline can be avoided, or if one or the other side will back down, or if they will break out into open fighting. The Egyptian military has been very smart in how they have done things. 1st, last Thursday, they announced they were moving troops into the vicinity of all the major cities but would take no action unless there were massive civil violence. Morsi thought they were doing so to help support his government...but it became apparent that the troops were actually there to prepare for Morsi's deposing when, on Monday, after reveiwing the size of the protests, the military issued an ultimatum to Morsi to step down...with troops already deployed across the country to enforce it.
