George Alexander Louis is the child's name. Louis Mountbatten was Prince Philip's uncle, and a strong presence in Prince Charles' life until his passing in 1979. ?Alexandra is one of Queen Elizabeth's middle names, so this is a nod to Her Majesty. Yesterday, William told members of the press that he and Catherine were still working on a name, even though one reporter tried to ask the Duke if George was in the running. The family left Kensington Palace, with mom in the backseat making sure Prince George was safe and sound. Kensington Palace will not be saying where the Cambridges are heading but they turned eastwards, not westwards towards Bucklebury, royal reporter Richard Palmer tweeted. ? However, others are saying that mom, dad and baby are in fact at Bucklebury Manor. Queen Elizabeth visited her great-grandson earlier this morning, as did?Prince Harry. ?Last night, Pippa and James Middleton were at the couple's temporary home to greet the boy. King George VI was the baby's great-great grandfather, and acceded to the throne when his brother, King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936.
