Ted Nugent wasted no time in providing ammunition to further stoke tensions over the George Zimmerman case. 	The conservative rocker and NRA board member took aim at the controversy surrounding a Florida jury?s not guilty verdict in the shooting death of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin -- calling the teen victim a ?dope smoking, racist gangsta wannabe.? 	In a column for the right-leaning site Rare, Nugent wrote the prosecutors were pressured into bringing a trial when it was obvious ?cut and dried self-defense.? 	?The race-baiting industry saw an opportunity to further the racist careers of Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Black Panthers, President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, et al, who then swept down on the Florida community refusing to admit that the 17-year-old dope smoking, racist gangsta wannabe Trayvon Martin was at all responsible for his bad decisions and standard modus operendi of always taking the violent route,? wrote Nugent. 	?Trayvon had no reason not to attack, because it was the standard thug thing to do. See Chicago any day of the week.? 	As tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and several other cities to protest the verdict, Nugent later told Newsmax that Martin was solely at fault for escalating the confrontation that ultimately led to his own death. 	The ?Cat Scratch Fever? guitarist ? a polarizing figure who called for arming teachers after the Sandy Hook massacre and is reportedly considering a bid for the White House in 2016 ? called for the disbarment of the entire prosecution team for bringing the Zimmerman case to trial. 	?Smart and honest America rejoices that the jury got it right,? Nugent said. ?This was the purest case of self-defense you could have ever asked for.?
