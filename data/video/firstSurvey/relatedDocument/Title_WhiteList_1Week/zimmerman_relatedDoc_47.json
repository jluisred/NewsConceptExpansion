A fired-up Solange Knowles staged a protest Sunday in downtown Brooklyn against the not-guilty verdict in the Trayvon Martin case. 	?Wear your hoodies, bring your signs, bring your voices!? the 27-year-old model and singer wrote on Twitter. 	Carrying a sign emblazoned with the words of Malcom X, ?I?m for truth, no matter who tells it. I?m for justice, no matter who it?s for or against,? Knowles was joined by hundreds at Borough Hall. She?s among countless celebs outraged over jurors? recent decision to free George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watchman who shot the 17-year-old unarmed black teen to death last year. 	?I am sick of racism and want to do something about it,? Knowles wrote, urging fans to sign an NAACP petition to open a civil rights case against Zimmerman, write to the Department of Jusice and call local officials.
