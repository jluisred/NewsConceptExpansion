As royal baby watchers breathe sighs of relief and jubilation at the announcement of the birth of the healthy baby boy, another waiting period begins. When will the name be announced and what will it be? According to babynames.uk, the name James means ?supplanter,? or one who takes the place of, or removes through force or strategy. Since the baby will be taking Prince Harry?s spot as third in line, and will subsequently bump the whole succession down, the definition would be fitting in a literal sense. Though, the name is better known in reference to the New Testament of the Bible, and two of Jesus?s disciples. It conjures the memory of James I of Scotland, who was known as a patron of the arts and a poet. Catherine?s brother?s name is also James William Middleton. George, on the other hand, means ?farmer,? or ?earth worker,? from Old French and Latin words of ?work? and ?earth.? St. George is known as the patron saint of England. He was thought to have been born into a Christian family and became an early martyr when the Emperor?Diocletian ordered the persecution of Christians.? The name became popular as King George I ascended the throne in 1714. Alexander is perhaps the boldest choice of the three, meaning ?to defend? or ?warrior.? The name is most often linked to Alexander the Great. Alexander II and his son, Alexander III, were both powerful kings of Scottland in the thirteen century.
