George Austin, nine, of south west London, met the Prince of Wales at Kemble railway station. He said: ?I was asking him about the baby and he said it was great meeting him at the hospital. The youngster was at the station, close to the Prince's Highgrove home, with his four-year-old sister Lucinda and their grandparents Sue and Peter Skinner. ?It is marvellous that the baby has been born, I think he will make the most fantastic grandfather,? said Mrs Skinner. ?Being a grandparent is very special. The Prince was given cards to congratulate him on the birth of his grandson, who was officially named by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on Wednesday evening ? around 50 hours after he was born. Oliver Horne, four, and brother Daniel, 22 months, wore Union flag hats for the royal visit and gave Prince Charles a card. This read: To HRH the Prince of Wales and HRH the Duchess of Cornwall. Congratulations on becoming grandparents on the birth of Prince George of Cambridge.? People at the event said the Prince seemed to be in a good mood, making jokes with parents and children alike as he opened the gardens. Staff and students from the Royal Agricultural University RAU redeveloped the garden. The Prince of Wales has been a president of the RAU for 25 years. Professor Chris Gaskell, principal of the Royal Agricultural University, said: He has double ownership of this project. He is pleased because he lives locally and loves bringing old things to life but he is also pleased that it was students from the RAU that put in the leg work. A new report by the leading drug watchdog, Drugscope, has revealed the average cost of illegal drugs on the streets of Britain. The annual snapshot survey involved consulting those working on the frontline in 17 towns and cities across Britain and has revealed a significant rise in street drug purities. The charity says the price of some drugs, such as heroin and ecstasy, has halved since the 1990s.
