Defence attorneys said the case was classic self-defence, claiming Martin knocked Zimmerman down and was slamming the older man's head against the concrete pavement when Zimmerman fired his gun. Zimmerman wasn't arrested for 44 days after the 26 February 2012 shooting, as police in Sanford insisted that Florida's 'stand your ground' law on self-defence prohibited them from bringing charges.
