Hard-partying Prince Harry is ready to set a good example for his newborn nephew, Prince George. 	Speaking in London shortly after meeting Prince William and Kate Middleton?s baby, Harry said Thursday he wanted ?to keep him out of harm?s way and make sure he has fun.? 	Harry?s idea of fun isn?t always wholesome. 	Last summer, Harry was photographed in his birthday suit during a game of strip billiards in Las Vegas. 	Harry said the baby was crying when he met him, ?just like all babies,? and that they had a good cuddle. 	He added that he?d be happy to take care of the royal infant on occasion ? for a price. 	?I only hope my brother knows how expensive my babysitting charges are!? Harry joked.
