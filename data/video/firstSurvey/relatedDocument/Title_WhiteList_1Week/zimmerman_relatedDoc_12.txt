Mr Zimmerman was acused of shooting and killing 17-year-old Martin as the teenager walked home from a sweet shop to his father?s house in a gated community in Sanford, near Orlando. ?We are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we?re doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities.?
