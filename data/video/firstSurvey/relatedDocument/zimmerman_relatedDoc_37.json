The February 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin caught the attention of the country ? especially Hollywood. Between Jamie Foxx wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with Martin?s face to major awards shows and Chaka Khan leading a tribute song following the Florida teen?s fatal shooting, celebrities helped keep the tragedy in the headlines. The tale came to an end late Saturday night, however, with George Zimmerman being proclaimed ?not guilty? by a jury of six. Social media was set ablaze by the news, with a multitude of celebs decrying the verdict and the Rev. Al Sharpton posting a statement on Facebook: ?The acquittal of George Zimmerman is a slap in the face to the American people but it is only the first round in the pursuit of justice. We intend to ask the Department of Justice to move forward as they did in the Rodney King case and we will closely monitor the civil case against Mr. Zimmerman. I will convene an emergency call with preachers tonight to discuss next steps and I intend to head to Florida in the next few days.?
