BBC reporter Jeremy Bowen was shot in the head and leg on Friday while covering the violence in Egypt. Bowen, the organization's Middle East editor, was at a demonstration which saw the Egyptian military kill a protester when it opened fire on the crowd. Bowen was hit in the head, just above his left ear, and in his leg by some shotgun pellets. He said the wounds were superficial. The BBC posted dramatic footage of Bowen wearing a gas mask with blood running down his face. Democracy Now correspondent Sharif Kouddous also tweeted the following image: Bowen told the Daily Mirror, I've been in a lot of hairy situations as a reporter over many years but I have never been hit by anything. By Saturday, Bowen said he was feeling much better. Journalists have been targeted repeatedly in the wake of the coup which removed Egypt's president, Mohammed Morsi, from power on Wednesday. At least one journalist has been killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Another was sexually assaulted. Al Jazeera's offices were raided, and soldiers cut off a CNN broadcast live on air.
