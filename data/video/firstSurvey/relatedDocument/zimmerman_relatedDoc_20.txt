Conservative televangelist Pat Robertson defended George Zimmerman in Monday's broadcast of the Christian Broadcasting Network's The 700 Club. Responding to co-host Terry Meeuwsen's point that Zimmerman was following 17-year-old Trayvon Martin when a 911 dispatcher asked him not to, Robertson implied that recent incidents in the area committed by hooded criminals justified his decision to do so. There had been some crime in the area, and the criminals were wearing these hoods, and so, it's one of those things, Robertson said. Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt, known as a hoodie, when Zimmerman ultimately shot him in the chest in February 2012. An autopsy determined Martin died of the gunshot wound. The hoodie became an important symbol in the controversy that ensued after Martin's death. Though he later apologized, Fox News host Geraldo Rivera said Martin's hoodie was as much responsible for his death as George Zimmerman. Meanwhile, protesters, NBA players and politicians wore hoodies to show their support for Martin and his family. On Saturday, an all-female jury found Zimmerman not guilty in Martin's death.
