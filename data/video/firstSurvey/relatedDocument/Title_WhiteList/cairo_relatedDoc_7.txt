The statement did not exactly define the people's demands but said that if they were not realised, the military would be obliged to announce a roadmap for the future . It is the second ultimatum to be given to Morsi and the opposition to reach an agreement. So far, President Morsi has vowed he will remain in his position, but the opposition and crowds in the street - who numbered in the millions nationwide - have made clear they will accept nothing less than his departure and a transition to early presidential elections. Any army move against Morsi after the two-day deadline risks a backlash from Morsi's Islamist backers, including his powerful Muslim Brotherhood and hard-liners, some of whom belong to former armed militant groups.
