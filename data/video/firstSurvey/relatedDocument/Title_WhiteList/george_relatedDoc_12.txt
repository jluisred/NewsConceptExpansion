Prince William and Kate Middleton chose the name George Alexander Louis for their newborn little boy, who bears the title of Prince of Cambridge. 	Their pick for the name follows widespread expectation, at least by British bookmakers. British firm Ladbrokes offered odds of 5/2 for the first name George. 	But the wee prince's moniker also reflects his family's heritage. 	George comes from the Greek word for farmer, and has been popular in England for centuries. The name is associated with St. George, the patron saint of England, who is said to have slain a dragon in the late third century. 	The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were likely thinking of the baby's great-great-grandfather King George VI. The new royal tot, when he ascends to the throne, will be known as King George VII. 	Alexander was also a popular prediction for the royal baby's name, modeled after Queen Elizabeth's middle name, Alexandra. The name Alexander also comes from Greek and means protector of men. 	The most famous figure that bears that name is Alexander the Great, who famously cobbled together an enormous empire, founding some twenty cities across Asia and Europe. Though there's never been a British ruler with that name, there were three Russian emperors with the name Alexander, and the current King of the Netherlands is named Willem-Alexander. 	Louis derives from the German Ludwig, which is a composite of the words for fame and warrior. It's one of Prince William's middle names-his full name is William Arthur Phillip Louis-and was also the name of Prince Philip's uncle, the Duke of Edinburgh. 	Louis is a traditional name for French monarchy, where there were sixteen kings with the moniker before the French Revolution.
