The US has urged Russia to return Mr Snowden, where he is wanted on espionage charges after disclosing details of secret surveillance programmes. President Barack Obama has spoken to Vladimir Putin, his Russian counterpart, over the issue. Mr Snowden told the activists that he would submit his asylum request the same day. Mr Lavrov said that under Russian law, asylum seekers must first make an official appeal to the Federal Migration Service. The service is yet to receive such a request. Mr Snowden has been stranded in the transit zone at the airport since he flew from Hong Kong after outing himself as the man behind the surveillance leaks.
