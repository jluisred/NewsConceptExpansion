Police barricaded a section of Union Square park early Sunday, clearing nearly 50 demonstrators who had gathered after George Zimmerman was found not guilty in the February 2012 deadly shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. 	The peaceful rally began around midnight, organizers said. Cops moved them out about 2 a.m. 	The protesters lit candles in paper cups over signs that read Emmett Till 1955. Trayvon Martin 2013 and Tonight a murderer walks free because of racism. 	The demonstrators said they were angry at what they described as a miscarriage of justice Saturday night in the Florida courthouse, where a six-woman jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder charges and a lesser charge of manslaughter for the Feb. 26, 2012, shooting that killed the unarmed Martin. 	 It's hard to comprehend what I saw on the television screen tonight ... If Zimmerman's able to get off this easily, what example does this set for people like him? said Aaron Black, 39, a consultant from the Bronx. I'm shocked. He should be doing jail time. I am fuming right now. 	Organizers said they hoped the impromptu showing, word of which spread through social media, would display the public's unrest with Florida's Stand Your Ground law. 	 People are upset, they're angry because they felt that Trayvon deserved justice. His parents, Tracy and Sybrina, deserve justice, said Thenjiwe M., 26. The state of Florida told not just black people, but everybody, that Trayvon's life didn't matter. That the lives of other young black people in similar situations don't matter. 	The protestors vacated the park peacefully but said they would return in stronger numbers at 6 p.m. Sunday to resume their rally.
