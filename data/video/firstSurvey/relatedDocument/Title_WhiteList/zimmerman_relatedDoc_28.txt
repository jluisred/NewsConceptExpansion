As news of George Zimmerman's acquittal in the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin spread across the U.S., Americans demonstrated their pain and anger using signs, chants and marches. 	From New York City to Los Angeles, thousands gathered in public squares and city centers to make their beliefs and frustration known, leading to the arrest of more than a dozen people. 	In Los Angeles police said they arrested six people, mostly for failure to disperse, after about 80 protesters gathered in Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard and an unlawful assembly was declared. In New York police said at least a dozen people were arrested on disorderly conduct charges during a rally in Times Square. 	Photos and videos taken by these and other passionate protesters capture the emotion of the gatherings over the course of two days. 	Now vigils in 100 cities are being planned for this coming Saturday before federal buildings. Advocates, led by Rev. Al Sharpton, ask that this time they only bring peace. 	NEW YORK CITY: 	?
