Prince George's christening will likely not be until this fall, but royal family members and friends are already brainstorming their gifts. 	India Hicks, the goddaughter of Prince Charles, revealed a set of cufflinks she had designed especially for the newborn Prince of Cambridge. The silver jewelry is monogrammed with the letter 'G.' 	 There certainly is a great tradition within the royal family of monogramming, going back over generations, so it just seemed an ideal present, Hicks told People magazin e. 	The model-turned-designer also dished about the tyke's proud father, Prince William. 	 Over the years we have seen William grow from a mischievous monkey into a reassuringly stable man, who values his close relationship with family and friends and honors his position with sensitivity and frankness, she said. 	Hicks' grandfather, Lord Louis Mountbatten, may have inspired one of the royal baby's middle names. 	 We are deeply touched that this new royal addition carried my grandfather's name, Hicks continued. My grandfather was not only a beloved uncle, but also mentor, to Prince Charles.
