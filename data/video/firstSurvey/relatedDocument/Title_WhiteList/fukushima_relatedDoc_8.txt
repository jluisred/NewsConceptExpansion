By Travelmail Reporter Published: 05:27 EST, 30 July 2013 | Updated: 05:27 EST, 30 July 2013 A popular Thai holiday island has seen its beaches turned black after an oil spill. Tourists are leaving the island of Koh Samet after the white sands were coated in crude oil after a major spill. As soldiers and volunteers gather to start to clear up the mess, tourism minister Somsak Phurisisak has said he is very concerned , explaining: I didn't think this spill would impact tourism in such an extreme way. However, he added: We're working to move visitors to other locations if they want to move. A leak in a pipe carrying crude oil caused 50 tonnes to spill into the Gulf of Thailand on Saturday and the clean-up operation is expected to take another two or three days. Koh Samet is just 142 miles southeast of Bangkok, making it popular with foreign and domestic tourists due to its location near to the capital. The worst hit is Ao Prao, or Coconut Bay, which is closed to the public while aircraft release chemical dispersant over the half-mile long oil slick. Tourists have been warned to stay away from the island's beaches in general, while hundreds of workers in white jumpsuits conduct the clean-up operation. Rayong province deputy governor Supeepat Chongpanish said: The top priorities right now are to get rid of the oil on the sand and the seawater, and to make sure the spill doesn't spread to other shores, He added: This is a very beautiful, white, sandy beach, so we want to make the spill go away as soon as possible. The company behind the accident, PTT Global Chemical Plc, said it detected a leak when a tanker moored offshore to transfer crude oil to a pipeline near Map Ta Phut, a large industrial estate in Southeast Asia. We've had some hotel cancellations on Samet, Rayong province tourism authority director Chuchart Oncharoen told the Bangkok Post. Whether this has a long-term impact on the island depends on how quickly PTT cleans up the mess.
