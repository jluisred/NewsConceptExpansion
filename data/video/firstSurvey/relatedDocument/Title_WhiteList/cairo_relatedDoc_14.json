The warning from Egypt?s military that the country?s politicians have 48 hours to resolve their differences fulfils the worst prophecies of those who voiced scepticism about the Cairo Spring of two years ago. Tahrir Square, the crucible of Egypt?s democratic awakenings, is once again crammed with protesters, many objecting to the outcome of the elections they so deeply craved. The demonstrations are even bigger than those that toppled Hosni Mubarak in 2011; the sense of betrayal is palpable. Yet the streets also teem with supporters of President Mohammed Morsi, who wants to turn Egypt away from a secular, West-leaning path. Tourism has collapsed and promised economic benefits have failed to materialise, though it was always fanciful to believe that Mr Morsi could deliver them after just one year in office. The good news so far is that, despite some clashes and fatalities in provincial towns, the protests in Cairo have been overwhelmingly peaceful. There has not been the collapse in order than many feared, which at least gives the politicians a window in which to reach some sort of accommodation. Mr Morsi has the legitimacy of having won the election, albeit narrowly; but he needs to be far more responsive to the wishes of those who do not want to see Egypt become another Middle Eastern theocracy. The new constitution, which enshrines a more Islamist vision of society and weakens protection for the rights of women and religious minorities, needs to be revisited. The Muslim Brotherhood says it wants talks, and the opposition should at least hear what it has to offer. The US, which encouraged the revolution that toppled Mubarak, has a role to play in getting the two sides together. Meanwhile, the military waits in the wings.
