But Mr Hrafnsson pointed out that WikiLeaks was now better able to raise money online. ?As of the beginning of this month, we have been able to open the direct donation route to the organisation because MasterCard basically backed down after two and a half years of blocking donations to us. So it is now much easier for people to express support for the organisation by donating to us,? he said. Asked about Mr Snowden?s conditions, Mr Hrafnsson said: ?I believe he is in a fairly good situation, and is well and in good spirits. A colleague of mine, Sarah Harrison, has been accompanying him since leaving Hong Kong.? He said the whistleblower was in contact with Julian Assange and his team. ?I cannot go into details of the nature of the communication between the WikiLeaks team and Mr Snowden, but it is a good line of communication,? he said. Meanwhile, Valentina Matviyenko, the speaker of Russia?s upper house of parliament, said on Wednesday that Russia was not taking any action over Mr Snowden because he had not applied for asylum in the country. Asked if the American?s stay at Moscow?s Sheremetyevo airport would spoil Russia?s image abroad, Mrs Matviyenko told reporters: ?In this case, Russia is strictly following the existing international rules. Agent Snowden is in the transit zone on the basis of the norms that exist. The situation is complicated; it has reached an impasse. What can Russia do? He is in the transit zone legally, like a normal transit passenger.?
