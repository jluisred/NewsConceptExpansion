But look a bit closer and you?ll see this is the new ?270million British Airways Airbus A380 ? the double-decker superjumbo that promises to revolutionise air travel. Guided by a Red Arrow plane over the white cliffs of Dover yesterday, it delighted onlookers ahead of the Royal International Air Tattoo show taking place this weekend. Scroll down for video To be launched at London Heathrow Airport in September, it is designed to be more spacious, comfortable, quieter and greener than other planes of its kind. Passengers are also promised a ?clean, purer and draught-free? quality of cabin air thanks to a new filtering system which changes the air every three minutes and uses special filters to allow 15 different temperature control zones.? It does this by creating a ?curtain of air? which descends softly from the top to the bottom of the cabin from where it is re-filtered and re-circulated. British Airways is the first airline in Europe to operate both the Airbus A380 and the rival Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The double-decker superjumbo plane can theoretically carry up to 800 people ? provided all the passengers are squeezed into narrow economy-sized seats. But British Airways? new A380s is making do with just 469 passengers across four classes of cabin classes ? with First and Business class passengers paying a hefty premium for the privilege. The A380?s first superjumbo long-haul return flight from London to Los Angeles, California, is on September 24, priced from ?621 in economy to ?2,550 in business and ?3,799 in First.
