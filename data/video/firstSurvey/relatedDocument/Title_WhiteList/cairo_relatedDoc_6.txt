The President spoke hours before a deadline from the country's military to yield to the demands of millions of protesters or see the military suspend the constitution, disband parliament and install a new leadership. We all built our army with our blood, sweat and resources. We want a strong army, he said. I want the army to be self-determined, having their own weapons and be supported by all the people. Don't you ever take the side of government supporters or opponents, because this is an insult to the army, he added.
