Journalists crowd inside the terminal F of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport News of the meeting had first been leaked by Genri Reznik, who the Interfax news agency. Mr Snowden has been stuck in the transit zone at Sheremetyevo as he negotiated for asylum. He had not been seen in public since arriving in Moscow from Hong Kong more than three weeks ago. He had fled from the Chinese city before making outing himself as the leaker behind US surveillance secrets. Russia had indicated that they would only grant Mr Snowden asylum if he stop publishing US intelligence secrets. It is unclear if he has now accepted this demand. Twitter: Ellen Barry - Big news is that #Snowden is applying for political asylum in Russia, despte Putin's condition that he stop publishing. from @TanyaLokshina
