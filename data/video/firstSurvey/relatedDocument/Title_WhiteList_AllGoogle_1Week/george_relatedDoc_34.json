This summer, the world got two very small yet important additions: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West?s daughter, North, and Prince William and Kate Middleton?s son, Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge. While the two tots may never meet, they?re both bound to have pretty good closets. We took a guess at what each infant might wear: little George in regal onesies fit for visits with the queen, and North in Lanvin, Herm?s?and even a miniature version of her mother?s infamous Givenchy dress. Drag and drop to dress the baby royalty.
