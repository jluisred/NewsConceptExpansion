The crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant is leaking contaminated water into the ocean and the Japanese government has known about the spillage. Tokyo?s admission comes 24 hours after Tepco ? the Tokyo Electric Power Company which operates the plant acknowledged for the first time the problem which has been suspected by experts for a long time. ?The Japanese government is taking this issue seriously. The Minister of Trade, Economy and Industry was instructed to act promptly to prevent contaminated water from leaking into the ocean,? said Yoshihide Suga the government?s chief cabinet secretary. The delayed announcement and belated apology underscored the criticisms the company has faced over the Fukushima crisis. Masayuki Ono a spokesman for Tepco apologised for the leaks. ?High readings of radiation were detected from the ground of the turbine building. We are very sorry for causing concerns for so many people and especially we deeply apologise to the people of Fukushima,? he said. The company has also come under fire for not revealing earlier that the number of workers with thyroid radiation exposures exceeding the threshold levels for cancer risks was 10 times what it had released earlier. Chemical solution is being pumped into the ground which will solidify and help prevent further leaks.
