the little prince July 24, 2013 1:45 p.m. This morning, Kate and Will left Kensington Palace by car and traveled to the Middletons' family home in Bucklebury, where they're expected to spend the next few weeks. Kate's dress, shown below, is by Seraphine, should you be interested. Just a few hours after their departure, the baby's name was announced by Kensington Palace via e-mail and Twitter. World, welcome?Prince George Alexander Louis, also known as?His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge! All three of those were on bookies' top-ten lists, by the way. ?Do we think they've known all along, or were they up all night debating the order of middle names? And what shall we nickname him? Boy George, anyone? Or GAL? Almost as good as Amtrak's writing residency program. You?ll find Shakespeare with a pie in his face. Kate Moss, Christy Turlington, and Linda Evangelista, plus a few baby pics of Ansel. Not too hot, not too uggo. You could, but not while you're pregnant and feeling crazy. 1/13/2015 at 4:40 p.m.Weddings at Starbucks? Sure, Some People Are Doing That Here's how to try it and not be a green-eyed monster.
