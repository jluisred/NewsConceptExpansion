Prince William and Kate Middleton have announced the name of their son - a little over two days after he was born. He has been named George Alexander Louis, and will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. A Clarence House spokesperson said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis. The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. Asked about his son's name, Prince William had promised he and Kate were working on it when they spoke to the media gathered outside the Lindo Wing about their new arrival yesterday. George is named after his great-great-grandfather King George VI, the Queen's father. Louis is one of William's middle names. It is also likely to be a tribute to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh's uncle and the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947. Mountbatten and William's father the Prince of Wales were very close, with Charles confiding in his relative. He was known by the Royal Family as Uncle Dickie and was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979, three years before William was born. His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo, Republic of Ireland. There has never been an English king called Alexander but three medieval Scottish kings ruled as Alexander. The couple are understood to have had a few ideas for names in mind and waited to confirm which one was right for their son, possibly conferring with their family when they visited. But it was William and Kate's decision what to call their firstborn and all three names picked were chosen because they liked them. George has long been the favourite with most bookies, and they were unanimous in their choice this morning. Prince Charles today confirmed William and Kate did not know the sex of the baby before the birth - perhaps explaining why they wanted a bit of extra time to make their decision. But while it took Charles and Diana a week to announce their new son's name, their grandson's was revealed rather quicker. George comes from the Greek for earth-worker or farmer, and dragon-slaying St George is the patron saint of England. Alexander derives from the Greek word meaning protector of men while Louis is the French and English form of the German name Ludwig, which means famous warrior or famous in battle. King George VI took George as his regnal name when he became king after his brother's abdication, but his full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George and he was known as Bertie to his family. George VI chose George in honour of his father George V and to create the impression of stability after the scandal caused by his brother Edward VIII giving up the throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson. His daughter Elizabeth, our current Queen, was introduced to her great grandson this morning when she visited William and Kate at Kensington Palace. Six King Georges have worn the crown throughout history since the German-born George I, the first Hanoverian king of Great Britain, acceded to the throne in 1714. George is also the fourth name of the Prince of Wales - the baby's grandfather. Even Edward VIII had George among his seven names. With Prince Charles able to choose a regnal name, Baby Cambridge could be King George VII or King George VIII depending on the name his grandfather chooses to use when he is king. George was the 12th most popular name for boys born in England and Wales in 2011 - expect it to climb up the charts as royal fans copy William and Kate's choice. There has only been one other Prince of Cambridge and he was also called George. The first Prince George of Cambridge was a grandson of George III and the only son of Prince Adolphus Frederick, the 1st Duke of Cambridge. Prince George of Cambridge was born in 1819 and refused to have an arranged marriage. He wed a commoner for love after falling for the actress Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, who was said to be a classic beauty and a graceful dancer. They married in 1847 when she was already the mother of two of his children and pregnant with his third. But the Duke did not seek the sovereign's approval and the marriage was never recognised, hence his children were not eligible to inherit royal titles. Miss Fairbrother, who generated much scandal including having a portrait painted in which she showed off her bare legs, was ostracised by the royal family and never given a title. Instead, she became known by the nickname Mrs FitzGeorge and this surname was taken by George's offspring. Despite his marriage, George had a wandering eye and soon after he wed he took up with mistress Louisa Beauclerk, who remained his lover for more than 30 years. He went on to become the 2nd Duke of Cambridge after his father's death. The Duke was in the Army and served in the Crimean War. He was promoted to Commander-in-Chief in 1887 and an equestrian statue of him stands in the middle of London's Whitehall. He was said to have been a disciplinarian, who believed Army promotions should be based on social connections rather than ability. He died in 1904. His father, the 1st Duke of Cambridge - who lived from 1774 to 1850 - was never a Prince of Cambridge, but was given the title the Duke of Cambridge by his father George III in 1801 when he was 27.
