The youngest in line for the British throne will be called Prince George, royal officials announced Wednesday. Prince William and Kate Middleton have named their son, born Monday, George Alexander Louis ? a decision that doesn't stray from tradition. In anticipation of the royal birth, George was considered a conventional and expected choice, topping the odds at the gambling firms taking bets on the prince's name. The selection is considered a nod to William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, whose father was King George VI. We're still working on a name, Prince William had told reporters when he and Kate brought their baby outside St. Mary's Hospital Tuesday. Royal watchers warned the name announcement might take some time. Prince Charles and Princess Diana did not announce William's name until a week after his birth. Queen Elizabeth took a month to come forth with Charles's name. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have gone about their royal duties with little drama or fuss ? though it took them three weeks to name their dog. Before the announcement of the baby's name, the queen visited the new prince at the hospital, and then William and Kate took their son to her parents' home near London. Prince William is on a two-week paid paternity leave from his job as a helicopter pilot in the Royal Air Force. Reportedly they plan on eventually moving into an apartment in Kensington Palace.
