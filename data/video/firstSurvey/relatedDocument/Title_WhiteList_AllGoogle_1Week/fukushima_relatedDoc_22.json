Cooling system shuts down during Fukushima test NOTE: THIS IS REACTOR NUMBER 6! Supposedly ?undamaged? by the earthquake tsunami. ?Mysterious? steam at Fukushima Unit 3 ? NPR: ?Fuel could have shifted? or worse restarted nuclear reactions? ? Tepco: ?We still don?t know for sure the cause?

The company?s best guess so far is that accumulated rainwater was being heated in some way. But, said the spokesman: ?We still don?t know for sure what the cause is.? [?]
