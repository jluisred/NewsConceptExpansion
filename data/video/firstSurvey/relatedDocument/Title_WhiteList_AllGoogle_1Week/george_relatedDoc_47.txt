George Alexander Louis is the name of Kate Middleton and Prince William?s first child! The 31-year-old Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to the heir to the British throne on Monday July 22 at 4:24pm in the Lindo Wing at St. Mary?s Hospital. ?The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.? Clarence House, Royal aid, tweeted just moments ago about the name. ?The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis.? Prince George weighed in at 8lbs, 6oz. and everyone is doing well following the birth. William released a short statement following the birth saying, ?We could not be happier.?

So conservative those Royals. I prefer the middle name as the first name?Alex is a cute nickname. July 24th, 2013 at 1:33 pm 			 George is such an old name. Alexander is should be. July 24th, 2013 at 1:34 pm 			 Ugh. July 24th, 2013 at 1:34 pm 			 LOVE THE NAAMEEE!! July 24th, 2013 at 1:35 pm 			 George is Queen Elizabeths brothers name did you see the King?s Speech. Thank goodness no Spencer or Earl after dear ol mom Ne er hear the sons talk about their mom and he goes to his mother in Laws house .. Now let?s bring out the Diana tapes again ! Perfect name For him! July 24th, 2013 at 1:35 pm 			 I think that?s an appropriate name for the heir to the throne. It?s nice to not see ?apple? or ?ivy? or ?north? anywhere?. July 24th, 2013 at 1:38 pm 			 Love the name. One name of great-grandma, grandfather and father each. Great idea. July 24th, 2013 at 1:41 pm 			 So much admiration and respect for these people! They are ROYALTY for God?s sake and they try to act so normal. This is a name, a NORMAL NAME! July 24th, 2013 at 1:43 pm 			 @Great name for next heir: Actually the Queen Elisabeth has no brother only younger sister, princess Margaret. The movie ?King?s speech? was about her father, King George V. July 24th, 2013 at 1:45 pm 			 Alexander would have been better as a first name. George is solid but staid. We?ve had so many King George?s its now like meh! July 24th, 2013 at 1:54 pm 			 @Kate ? Actually, the Queen?s father was King George VI, not King George V. July 24th, 2013 at 1:58 pm 			 Hopefully now the monarchy can get back to basics: incest, adultery, beheadings, starving of the peasants, and just good ole mayhem. July 24th, 2013 at 1:59 pm 			 For everyone saying they are happy William and Kate didn?t name him something outrageous like ?North? or ?Apple? ? what made you think they would? They are British royalty, not C-List brainless celebrities. It should have been expected they would name him normally. July 24th, 2013 at 2:07 pm 			 I called ?George? correctly. Just ask my husband. July 24th, 2013 at 2:10 pm 			 Oh, Great Name for Next Heir, Queen Elizabeth has no brother, only a deceased sister, Margaret the Partier. George was the name of her father and grandfather. July 24th, 2013 at 2:11 pm 			 The baby?s name is LOUIS not LEWIS!!!! #Fail July 24th, 2013 at 2:13 pm 			 Another point, Great Name for Next Heir, ?Earl? is not a Spencer family name. It is a title, like ?Duke? and ?Prince? are titles. Diana?s brother is the 9th Earl of Spencer. Sheesh. July 24th, 2013 at 2:34 pm 			 I HATE it. Sorry. George is such a common monarch name, like someone said, it?s ?meh?. I would have loved James. It?s classic as well, but has a better modern vibe. Oh well. July 24th, 2013 at 2:53 pm 			 love the name! Just knew Alexander would have been one of them! July 24th, 2013 at 2:56 pm 			 not a fan of George either.. reminds me of an old dude July 24th, 2013 at 2:57 pm 			 i would?ve loved Louis Philipp Spencer. July 24th, 2013 at 3:32 pm 			 I have a feeling this kid will start calling himself Alex or Alexander. Similarly, William which isn?t as dated as George calls himself Will, and Henry calls himself Harry. King Alex, or Prince Alex works. July 24th, 2013 at 3:34 pm 			 So, after all the talk and the changes to the consitution which would make a little princess Queen one day?it was a little G.A.L after all?.ha, ha?.I rather like the irony. July 24th, 2013 at 3:52 pm 			 The child is named after his great great grandfather, but it is still an ugly name. July 24th, 2013 at 4:04 pm 			 The only bad name in that is George..But Alexander & Louis? EPIC !!!! I hope he prefers Prince Alexander kind of like Prince Harry is known by Harry and not Henry his first name Derek Hough holds tight to his pal Jamie Chung while dipping her into a dance move while having a...
