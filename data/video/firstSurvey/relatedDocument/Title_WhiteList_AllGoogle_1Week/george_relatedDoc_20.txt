The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis, reads a statement from Kensington Palace. The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. The prince was born Monday at London's St. Mary's hospital. After greeting the world outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital, spending his first night at home in Kensington Palace and meeting his great grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, Prince George and his parents have headed to the home of Carole and Michael Middleton in Bucklebury, about 55 miles west of London, where they'll spend time with the proud grandparents. It's very emotional, Kate, 31, said of becoming a mother on Tuesday. It's a moment that any parent having just given birth will know what this feeling feels like.
