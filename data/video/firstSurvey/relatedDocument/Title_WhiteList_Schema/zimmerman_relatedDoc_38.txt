Many celebrities have been vocal about Saturday's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, from passionate Twitter reactions to moments of silence at concerts. Bruce Springsteen joined the ranks of those protesting the verdict on Tuesday, dedicating his song American Skin 41 Shots to the slain teenager at a Limerick, Ireland, concert, according to The Star Ledger. After seeing a sign in the crowd with the song title scrawled across it, the Boss asked Where is that sign and grabbed it. I want to send this one out as a letter back home, Springsteen said. For justice for Trayvon Martin. You can get killed just for living in your American skin, the song's lyrics say, which Springsteen wrote in 1999 following the police shooting death of Amadou Diallo ? a 23-year-old Guinea immigrant ? in New York City. The Star Ledger reports that Springsteen opened and closed his Limerick set with This Little Light of Mine, which may have also been a reaction to the Zimmerman verdict.
