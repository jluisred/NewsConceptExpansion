LOS ANGELES AP ? Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti says violence and vandalism in city streets has resulted in 13 arrests in protests over George Zimmerman's Florida acquittal in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Speaking at a news conference with Garcetti late Monday, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said about 150 people broke off from a larger, peaceful protest and began walking through the streets, committing multiple acts of vandalism and several assaults. The officials didn't elaborate on the assaults or any potential injuries. Beck says more than 300 officers were called to the scene. They were slow to directly engage the protesters in an attempt to allow a peaceful end to the demonstration. But Beck says police would take a much stricter posture if the protests continued for another night. Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
