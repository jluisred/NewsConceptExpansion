The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stepped out of St. Mary's Hospital in London a little more than 24 hours after Kate gave birth to a baby boy. The Duchess held the baby as the couple walked down the front steps and waved to the adoring crowd. She handed the baby to William before they took questions from media. Baby Cambridge's name wasn't released during this time, but we now know he will be called George Alexander Louis. Prince George is seen wiggling his fingers as his parents answer questions. The couple moved inside to buckle the baby into his car seat, then came back out to a waiting car, which William drove to Kensington Palace.
