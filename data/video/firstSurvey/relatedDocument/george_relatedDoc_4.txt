Away from the Palace and through the supporters, to grandmother's house we go! After a visit from great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth at Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace on Wednesday, The Duke, Duchess and Prince of Cambridge hit the road and headed to Bucklebury for some quality time with Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton. As they pulled away from the Palace, William sat in the front seat as Kate waved to crowds from the back, where she sat with her newborn son. Shielded by sunglasses in a printed blue dress with her hair in a ponytail ? a much different look than the long, voluminous hair style she wore to debut the baby a day prior ? Kate looked relaxed as she looked into the infant's car seat. The Middletons ? who were the royal baby's first visitors, arriving at the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London around 3 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon ? live about 55 miles from London. Their home is where Kate spent her last hours of pregnancy before going into labor early Monday morning. Following their hour-long visit, Carole spoke to the throngs of reporters outside the hospital. He's absolutely beautiful, she said, speaking for herself and her husband. Regarding Kate and the baby, Carole added, They are both doing well. We are absolutely thrilled. Can't get enough about the royal baby? Be among the first to know the news!
