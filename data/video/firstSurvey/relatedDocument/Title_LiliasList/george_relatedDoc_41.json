Punters who have had a flutter on what the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will call their baby may have a little wait before any formal announcement. It was seven days before the Prince and Princess of Wales revealed that they had chosen William as the name for their firstborn, although Prince Harry was named immediately. Before the birth, bookmakers made George from 7 -1 to 10-1 a favourite. There have been six previous reigning Georges. James has also attracted money 12-1, although one bookmaker had James as 6-1 . Last night both had been cut to 3-1 and 4-1 respectively. James has strong royal ties, with two English kings and six Scottish kings ? something to bear in mind as the Scottish independence debate rages. It is also the name of Kate's brother. Edward and Charles are seen as unlikely first names, but could be suitable as middle names. So could Michael, should Kate wish to honour her father. Arthur, the name Charles apparently wanted to give William, was the last surviving son of Victoria.
