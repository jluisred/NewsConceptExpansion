The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have proudly showed the world their baby son, a future king, before taking him home. William and Kate emerged from the Lindo wing of St Mary's hospital in London to begin their new lives as parents, cradling their baby prince and posing for pictures on the steps outside. The duchess and William walked forward to answer a few questions from the massed waiting media. He said: He's got a good pair of lungs on him, that's for sure. He's a big boy, he's quite heavy. We are still working on a name so we will have that as soon as we can. He added: It's the first time we have seen him really so we are having a proper chance to catch up. The duchess, wearing a blue polka-dot dress, said: It's very emotional. It's such a special time. I think any parent will know what this feeling feels like. Her husband agreed: It's very special. William said: He's got her looks, thankfully, while Kate replied: No, no, I'm not sure about that. Joking about his apparent lack of hair the duke said about his son: He's got way more than me, thank God. The couple's good humour continued during their brief questioning from the press with Kate revealing that her husband was a hands-on dad. Asked about changing nappies William said: We've done that already, and Kate said: He's done his first nappy already. William added: I'll remind him of his tardiness when he's a bit older. I know how long you've all been standing here so hopefully the hospital and you guys can all go back to normal now and we can go and look after him. The couple then returned inside to fetch the car child seat before departing for Kensington Palace.
