The hip-hop star Jay Z and his equally famous wife, the singer Beyonc? Knowles, were among those protesting in New York on Saturday over the acquittal of George Zimmerman on charges of murdering the black teenager Trayvon Martin. The pair were seen outside the NYPD headquarters in downtown Manhattan as the demonstration got under way. The crowds, which numbered into the several hundreds, cheered the famous couple's arrival. Thank you, Jay! shouted one protester. A chant of no concerts in Florida broke out. A boycott of the state has been announced by the soul star Stevie Wonder, following the not guilty verdict by a Florida jury last week. Pictures tweeted by some at the New York rally, purportedly show Beyonc? and Jay Z with the Reverend Al Sharpton and Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother. Sharpton, the veteran civil rights activist who organised the 100-city action on Saturday, and Fulton are both expected to speak at the New York demonstration and call on the Justice Department to launch a civil rights prosecution against Zimmerman. Beyonc? has publicly backed calls for a civil rights case, writing on her website: We must fight for Trayvon the same way the generation before us fought for Emmett Till. Till, aged 14, was murdered in 1955 in a case that was pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. His murderers were acquitted by an all-white jury. Both Beyonc? and Jay Z have become high-profile advocates in the Justice for Trayvon Martin campaign. On the night of the jury acquittal, last Saturday, Beyonc? asked an audience in Nashville to have a moment of silence for Trayvon . Following a long pause, she performed a solemn rendition of the chorus from I Will Always Love You, then transitioned into one of her hits, Halo. The following night, Jay Z took a few seconds out from his his final Wireless festival set, noting: Rest in peace, Trayvon Martin.
