Prince William and Kate Middleton need to cut loose from tradition -- naming their kid George Alexander is right out of the royal playbook -- which dare we say is getting a little dusty. We're not saying the royals need to steal a page from Gwyneth Paltrow and name the kid after fruit, but it wouldn't be terrible to give the kid a name that's a little more fun than George. No offense, Mr. Clooney. But let's face it ... the most awesome royal name ever is not held by a royal at all ... it's held by a Jackson -- All hail Jermajesty!?
