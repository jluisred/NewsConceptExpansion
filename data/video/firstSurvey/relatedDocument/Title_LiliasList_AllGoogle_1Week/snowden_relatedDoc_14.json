Fugitive Edward Snowden has applied for asylum in Russia, and his lawyer has told the press that his client has no plans to leave Russia just yet, and may apply for citizenship. Documents confirming the application ended days of reports that Snowden had indeed decided not to go on to his preferred South American refuge, and President Putin, who says he wants him to leave underlined no-one would be giving Moscow orders as to his fate. ?We can?t and we wouldn?t act like other countries. Russia has an independent foreign policy and will continue with it. I hope that our partners will understand that and will keep calm and will understand the situation. Interstate connections are much more important than special services? dirty tittle tattle,? he said. Snowden?s lawyer added his client felt attempting to travel to Latin America at this time would be unsafe as the USA would try to get him extradited. He is believed to have approached several countries for asylum, with Ecuador or Venezuela the most likely destinations. Wherever he ends up, Washington is liable to exert enormous pressure to get him back. 1 The power of the pen: Cartoonists worldwide react to the Charlie Hebdo attack | euronews, world news 9 France: Angouleme council takes down anti-homeless cages around benches after outcry | euronews, world news 14 eurovibes - a selection of Europe?s best music talent 18 world Weather | euronews: world ten day weather forecast
