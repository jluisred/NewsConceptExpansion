When the crowd surged forward, someone opened fire straight away from the military side, before they used any kind of tear gas ... I saw the body . Three people are thought to have been killed on Friday afternoon when supporters of the deposed Muslim Brotherhood ruler, Mohamed Morsi, clashed with those who had demanded his removal. Protesters pelted the line of troops with stones, and the soldiers responded with volleys of tear gas, but the clashes appeared for the moment to ease with midafternoon prayers. The shootings may cause an escalation in Egypt's confrontations, with supporters of Mr Morsi ? largely Islamists ? rejecting the army's removal of the country's first freely elected president on Wednesday night and installation of a new civilian administration. The protester casualties are likely to further fuel calls by some in the Islamist movement for violent retaliation. The Brotherhood called for Friday's protests, which took place at several sites around the capital and in other cities. Brotherhood officials underlined strongly to their followers that their rallies should be peaceful.
