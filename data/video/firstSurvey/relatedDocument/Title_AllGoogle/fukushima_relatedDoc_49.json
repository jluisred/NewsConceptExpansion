The state secret protection law was enacted in December 2013. Ahead of its enforcement, the government set guidelines for implementing the law and launched bodies to supervise the ways information is designated as state secrets. Still, concerns remain, mainly among opposition parties and journalists, due to the possibility of an arbitrary decision by the state to expand the scope of state secrets and extend the period of designation. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a press conference on Tuesday that the government will properly implement the law and work to keep the public's right to know through reports to parliament and public disclosure. The government will continue to try hard to gain the understanding of the public, he said. At a separate press conference, Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa said that the law will be implemented in accordance with the basic principle of designating the minimum information for the minimum period necessary as state secrets. 2014/12/10-00:28 http://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&k=2014120900679 IOC backs plan to share Olympic events World Dec. 8, 2014 - Updated 05:17 UTC-5 The International Olympic Committee has approved a proposal that allows some events to be held outside a host city for cost-cutting and environmental reasons. 96 committee members unanimously adopted the proposal at the IOC's extraordinary General Assembly session in Monaco on Monday. In exceptional cases, the proposal also allows events to be held outside the host country. The IOC approval raises the possibility that the South Korean city of Pyeongchang may ask Japan or other neighbors to host some events during the 2018 Winter Games. The city is said to be facing financial difficulties in hosting the games. Tokyo may also speed up a review of its own plan for the 2020 Summer Games to stage some events in other cities. Use of emergency medical helicopters on the rise Japan Dec. 7, 2014 - Updated 10:40 UTC-5 Japanese authorities say helicopters were dispatched more than 20,000 times for emergency medical services during the fiscal year that ended in March. 43 helicopters have been deployed in 36 of Japan's 47 prefectures. They are used to transport teams of doctors and nurses between remote areas and hospitals. Patients being airlifted to hospitals can also receive emergency medical treatment on board. The Japanese Society for Aeromedical Services says demand for the helicopters has been on the rise since they were first used in 1999. 20,632 aeromedical dispatches were recorded in fiscal 2013. Each helicopter took part in an average of 480 operations during this period. Locals Mixed over N-Reactors ahead of Japan General Election Tokyo, Dec. 9 Jiji Press--Less than a week before Japan's crucial House of Representatives election on Sunday, residents in areas that host nuclear power plants are mixed in their views over whether idled reactors should be brought back online. Currently, procedures to restart reactors are being taken at many nuclear power stations, while efforts are continuing to control the crisis at Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant, which was crippled by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Although all 48 reactors in Japan have remained offline, there have been no power shortages. Still, many utilities are raising their electricity rates as the prices of imported fuel for thermal power stations that have replaced reactors have surged partly reflecting the yen's sharp deterioration. 2014/12/09-19:50 http://jen.jiji.com/jc/eng?g=eco&k=2014120900797 France Backs Anti-Drone Research After Mystery Nuclear Flights http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-09/france-backs-anti-drone-research-after-mystery-nuclear-flights.html The News That Matters about the Nuclear Industry http://nuclear-news.net/ duration: 14:19 published: 10 Dec 2014 updated: 10 Dec 2014 views: 84 duration: 44:47 updated: 03 Sep 2014 views: 816 duration: 1:22 published: 12 Mar 2011 updated: 06 Sep 2014 views: 656224 author: DOSEDcoUK duration: 8:59 published: 01 Mar 2014 updated: 02 Sep 2014 views: 23359 duration: 4:18 published: 30 Jul 2013 updated: 03 Sep 2014 views: 110641 duration: 2:11 published: 03 Aug 2013 updated: 30 Aug 2014 views: 150455 duration: 87:52 published: 17 Sep 2011 updated: 06 Sep 2014 views: 237447 author: vidsupquick duration: 10:01 published: 15 Aug 2013 updated: 05 Sep 2014 views: 523441 author: M o'rourke duration: 29:04 published: 01 Oct 2012 updated: 18 Jul 2014 views: 13894 author: CWS duration: 12:05 published: 07 Apr 2011 updated: 02 Sep 2014 views: 1025465 author: videonewscom duration: 2:03 published: 28 Jun 2013 updated: 26 Aug 2014 views: 31284 duration: 6:58 views: 1191 duration: 11:36 published: 11 Mar 2014 updated: 04 Sep 2014 views: 7164 duration: 38:13 published: 05 Apr 2014 updated: 06 May 2014 views: 163 duration: 114:15 published: 12 Apr 2011 updated: 01 Sep 2014 views: 101355 duration: 17:32 published: 24 Jan 2014 updated: 24 Jan 2014 views: 950 Govt. compiles strategy on regional revival Japan Dec. 26, 2014 - Updated 01:58 UTC-5 Japan's government has compiled measures aimed at reviving the nation's regional communities. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe presented 2 sets of policy programs to a panel of experts on Friday. One is a comprehensive strategy outlining a course of action for the next 5 years. The other sets out a longer-term vision. The 5-year strategy is aimed at increasing regional populations by creating 300,000 jobs for young people. It calls for annual increases of 100,000 regional jobs after the period. The strategy also includes raising the number of people moving out of the Tokyo metropolitan area by 40,000 from the 2013 level in 2020, and lowering the number moving into the area by 60,000. The long-term vision focuses on increasing Japan's fertility rate. It's aimed at increasing the number of children born to the average woman to around 1.8 by 2030, so that Japan can keep its shrinking population at about 100 million in 2060. New method for contaminated water may be failing Nuclear & Energy Dec. 26, 2014 - Updated 06:32 UTC-5 Tokyo Electric Power Company has indicated that a new method aimed at tackling a large volume of highly radioactive wastewater at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant has not been entirely successful. TEPCO gave a progress report on its work to a panel of experts at the Nuclear Regulation Authority on Friday. The utility last month began pouring cement into underground tunnels filled with the contaminated water from the reactor buildings to stop the water inflow. The water is believed to be leaking into the sea. TEPCO officials told the panel that workers have completely filled the U-shaped tunnels except for 4 vertical pits that connect the tunnels to the ground surface. They removed 2,500 tons of radioactive water. But the officials said that when they pumped water up from one of the pits, the water level at another pit changed. That suggests that gaps exist in the concrete-filled tunnels. Lack of communication in Fukushima disaster Nuclear & Energy Dec. 25, 2014 - Updated 22:49 UTC-5 Newly released testimony points to a failure to share key information during the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in March 2011. The Japanese government on Thursday released another set of accounts of the disaster, containing testimony from government officials and staff at Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, who dealt with the disaster. The accounts reveal that not all workers and officials knew that an emergency cooling system for the No.1 reactor had been manually shut down following the earthquake and tsunami. Fuel rods at the No.1 reactor melted down later that day and a hydrogen explosion the next day damaged the reactor further. Govt. releases more accounts of Fukushima disaster Nuclear & Energy Dec. 25, 2014 - Updated 15:08 UTC-5 The Japanese government has released more interview accounts of the 2011 nuclear accident. 772 interviews were conducted in 2011 and 2012 by a government committee that investigated the disaster. The testimonies came mainly from government officials and staff from Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. Some testimonies including those from then prime minister Naoto Kan, and then plant chief Masao Yoshida have already been released. An additional 127 were made public on Thursday after receiving consent from interviewees. Among those newly released is one from a worker at Tokyo Electric headquarters. He analyzed conditions inside the reactors in early April 2011 when the effects of the disaster began to unfold. The official said he thought the upper half of the nuclear fuel rods at the No.1 reactor core must have completely melted. Cooling water was covering only the lower half of the rods. 4 youths in Fukushima found with thyroid cancer Nuclear & Energy Dec. 25, 2014 - Updated 06:44 UTC-5 Health officials in Japan's Fukushima Prefecture say 4 local young people may have thyroid cancer, even though they cleared a screening shortly after the nuclear power plant accident there in 2011. A panel of experts on Thursday announced the results of the latest round of screening, which started in April. The 4 people were 6 to 17 years old at the time of the Fukushima Daiichi accident. Fukushima Prefecture has been conducting thyroid checkups regularly on more than 380,000 residents who were younger than 18 at the time of the disaster. Some scientists say radioactive isotopes of iodine released in the accident may accumulate in children's thyroids and cause cancer. The first round of screening in 2011 found 108 confirmed or suspected cases of cancer. duration: 14:53 published: 27 Dec 2014 updated: 27 Dec 2014 views: 110 duration: 40:14 published: 31 Oct 2013 updated: 31 Oct 2013 views: 1681 duration: 0:48 published: 13 Mar 2011 updated: 12 Jul 2014 views: 40579 author: newoaknl duration: 21:11 published: 11 Oct 2013 updated: 04 Sep 2014 views: 13120 Out Connect:
