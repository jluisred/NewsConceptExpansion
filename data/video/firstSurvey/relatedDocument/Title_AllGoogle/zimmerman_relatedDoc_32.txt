Protests over the George Zimmerman verdict broke out over the weekend in Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and New York, along with at least a dozen other U.S. cities. On Monday, protests spread to the U.K., too, where they attracted members of socialist groups, trade unions and African cultural associations. Monday afternoon, demonstrators gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in London to draw attention to the inherent racism in the American system and demand justice for Trayvon Martin, according to a Facebook event page. The rally was organized by two British leftist groups, the Left Activist Solidarity Network, a network of socialists, communists and anarchists, and Stand Against Fascism, an anti-fascist group. On Tuesday, the National African Caribbean Forum, an African cultural association, says it's planning a second demonstration at the embassy. Staffers at the embassy in London told U.S. News they were unaware of the protests. A black trade unionists group in the U.K., Black Activists Rising Against Cuts, also plans to jump into the fray with an emergency organizing meeting on the verdict Monday night. President Obama calls for calm in the aftermath of Zimmerman acquittal. I say stay black, remain proud and demand justice, the group's co-chair, Lee Jasper, wrote on Facebook. Obama called for a peaceful response Sunday in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the February 2012 shooting death of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla. Over the weekend, musicians in the U.K. also sought to pay tribute to Martin at London's Yahoo Wireless Music Festival, according to Mobo.com, a black music website based in the U.K. This s--t happens everyday and it ain't fair man, American hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest told fans at the show.
