Prince William and Duchess Catherine have named their baby boy Prince George Alexander Louis. The royal couple revealed their son's name for the first time shortly before 7pm today 24.07.13 , just hours after relocating to the home of Duchess Catherine's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, in Bucklebury, Berkshire, South East England. Kensington Palace released a short statement to confirm the news: ''The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis. ''The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.'' A source close to the couple also told the MailOnline website that the traditional names are not symbolic but that William and Catherine just really liked them. The Duke, Duchess and Prince of Cambridge left Kensington Palace in London at approximately 12:55 pm today and were driven to the home of Catherine's parents in the same Range Rover that collected them from the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on Tuesday 23.07.13 . The new family departed shortly after a visit from William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, the ruling monarch of the UK and Commonwealth. The 31-year-old royal's brother Prince Harry, 28, also paid a visit to his two-day old nephew but managed to get in and out of Kensington Palace without being spotted. The family arrived at the Middleton home at around 1:45pm and their arrival was assisted by a marked Thames Valley Police van, which blocked off the entrance to the country road leading to the ?5 million property, while two uniformed police officers also guarded the road. Catherine - known as Kate Middleton before she married the prince - William and Baby Cambridge are expected to stay at the Middleton home for the next week at least.
