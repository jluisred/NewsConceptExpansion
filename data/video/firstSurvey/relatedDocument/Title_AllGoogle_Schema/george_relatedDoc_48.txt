Just one day after being introduced to the world via his parents Kate Middleton and Prince William , the Royal Baby?s name has been revealed: George Alexander Louis, or if you want to be fancy about it, ?His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.? Earlier today, Queen Elizabeth II visited her new great-grandson ? her third great-grandchild and the third in line to the British throne ? at Kensington Palace for the first time, before William and Kate took the Royal Baby to visit his maternal grandparents Kate?s parents . Prince Harry has also been to see his new nephew, palace officials said, as have Kate?s brother and sister, Pippa and James Middleton. Both sets of grandparents visited the little prince in the hospital on Tuesday. According to the BBC, it took a week for William?s parents ? Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana ? to announce his name in 1982, while the Prince of Wales? name wasn?t revealed for a whole month when he was born in 1948. Prince Harry?s name, however, was made public as soon as he left the hospital in 1984.
