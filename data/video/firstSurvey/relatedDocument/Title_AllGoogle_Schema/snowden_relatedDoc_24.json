US fugitive Edward Snowden has made a public statement to the media at Moscow Airport. The former US government contractor met with members of activist group Human Rights Watch, who later transmitted an audio message from him to a huge crowd of journalists. ?I did not seek to enrich myself,? Snowden said.
