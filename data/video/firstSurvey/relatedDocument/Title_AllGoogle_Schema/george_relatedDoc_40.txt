Prince William and Duchess Kate have finally answered the biggest remaining question about their new royal bundle of joy, naming their first-born son George Alexander Louis, the Prince of Cambridge. George was the name of Queen Elizabeth II's father and grandfather, and it also happens to be the name of the patron saint of England. If he sticks with the name when he is crowned as the monarch, he would be King George VII, though he is allowed to change it upon coronation. George VI was born Albert Frederick. 	According to the popular gambling site Paddy Power, George was a 2-1 favorite by bettors trying to predict the royal baby name. Coincidentally, Alexander was the third most popular choice, and Louis was fourth. Alexandra is also Elizabeth's middle name and Louis is William's fourth name, although obviously all three names have many royal connections in England and beyond.
