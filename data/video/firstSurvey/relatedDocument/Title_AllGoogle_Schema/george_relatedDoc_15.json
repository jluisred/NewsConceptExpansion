He led the country through WWII and died in 1952. Bookies had pegged George as the favourite?name since the announcement that the couple had had a baby boy. A William Hill spokesman said before the name was revealed: George was the second most popular name before we knew whether the baby would be a boy or girl, so now it moves into pole position and is the red hot favourite to be the name of the new prince. Louis had also been tipped, with odds of 12/1. Ladbrokes spokesperson Jessica Bridge told IBTimes UK: As soon as the news broke of the birth, we were taking ?900 a hour on the name. Henry is causing us a headache as it will be a pay-out of ?100,000. So we're staring down a bit of a royal cannon on that one. As soon as we found out the sex, then the betting went in to overdrive. This is a really unusual event, it is the most exciting novelty event we've ever seen. It's like a posher Grand National.
