MOSCOW ??Edward Snowden has officially applied for temporary Russian asylum with the Federal Immigration Agency, a Moscow-based human rights lawyer close to the fugitive whistleblower said on Tuesday. Russian Civic Chamber?s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said he had given legal advice to the fleeing NSA agent. ?I told him about all the intricacies of the procedure. It was decided that a staff member from the FMS office will come to the airport to accept Snowden?s temporary asylum request, as he is not allowed to leave Sheremetyevo?s transit zone?, the lawyer said. Ex-CIA employee Edward Snowden said in his request for refugee in Russia that his life would be under threat and that he fears torture and persecution in the U.S., said Anatoly Kucherena. ?He wrote that he fears for his life and security, and that he could be subjected to torture or face the death penalty,? Kucherena said on Tuesday. Edward Snowden will be able to move across Russian territory while Moscow looks into his bid for political asylum, reported VOR. An informed police source told reporters a special permit will be issued for the American intelligence leaker, stranded in a no-man?s-land in Moscow?s airport lounge, giving him freedom to travel. The source said Snowden?s asylum plea would be considered even in the absence of any ID. Washington previously annulled the whistleblower?s US passport to. The Russian immigration authority may take some five days to preview the request, although a deeper inquest will probably last up to three months, the source informed.
