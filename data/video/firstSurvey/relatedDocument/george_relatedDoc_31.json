The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived at the Middleton family home in Bucklebury with their new baby, following an earlier visit from the Queen at Kensington Palace. The new parents left their west London home after the Queen had seen her great-grandson for the first time. She spent half an hour at Kensington Palace with the proud parents and their son, the third in line to the throne, who was born to great fanfare earlier this week. The Queen had earlier said she was ?thrilled? at the arrival of the Prince of Cambridge,?who is yet to be named. William?s brother Prince Harry also went to see his nephew today. When the Duke and Duchess left the private Lindo Wing of St Mary?s Hospital in west London yesterday, William said: ?We?re still working on a name so we will have that as soon as we can.? George is the favourite for the future king, followed by James and Alexander. A spokesman for the couple said the 31-year-olds would now focus on caring for their baby. ?This is now private and quiet time for them to get to know their son,? he said. The Queen is now set to go on her annual summer break to Balmoral, although the Duke of Edinburgh is expected to continue convalescing at Windsor Castle after exploratory abdominal surgery last month.
