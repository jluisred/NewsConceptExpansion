Prince William and Kate have announced the name of their newborn baby. He is to be George Alexander Louis and will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. The name George had been the bookmakers? favourite for the new prince, who is third in line to the throne. The announcement from Kensington Palace brought to an end much speculation. The guessing game over the name was much shorter than the waiting game for the baby?s birth. Confirmation of the new name came just a day after the Duchess of Cambridge left hospital, and very quickly by royal standards. Six King Georges have worn the crown since George 1 came to the throne in 1714. The last, George VI, was the father of Queen Elizabeth and reigned from 1936 to 1952. Links to the past Alexandra, the female form of Alexander, is one of Queen Elizabeth?s middle names, and was also the name of the queen consort of King Edward VII at the start of the last century. Louis is one of William?s middle names, and was the given name of Prince Charles?s mentor and great-uncle Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. The choice of name, which is relatively short by royal standards, does not necessarily mean the baby will eventually become King George VII. The queen?s father was christened Albert, but chose to be crowned as George VI. Safe and ordinary ?It?s interesting that they chose to go with just three names. It?s almost as if the royal family is coming down with ordinary people, who tend to have fewer middle names than monarchs,? historian Suzannah Lipscomb said. ?It is a name that none can find any problems with. George itself can?t be shortened in any obvious offensive way ? They?ve probably gone for something that is safe.? The names appeared to have no direct connection to the mother?s side of the family. ?They?ve kept it very simple by not trying to represent all parts of the family,? said royal historian Tracy Borman. 1 euronews live TV - News | euronews : the latest international news as video on demand 2 eurovibes - a selection of Europe?s best music talent 3 Exclusive: CIA and Mossad are behind Boko Haram and ISIL, says Sudan president | euronews, world news 4 European Union News | euronews: latest breaking news and headlines about European Union 5 Greek debt: who will pay if Greece fails? | euronews, world news 6 Dramatic dashcam video captures Taiwan plane crash | euronews, world news 8 Getting to know Sir Tony and ?the world?s greatest tenor? | euronews, musica 9 English and Spanish among happiest languages | euronews, world news 10 Watch: Ukraine MPs in fierce fist fight outside parliament | euronews, world news 11 euronews apps : iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone 8, Windows 8, Nokia S40, Nokia Asha, Smart TV and Google Glass 12 Greece decides: Live updates on a pivotal Greek general election | euronews, world news 13 Data ?mocks? claims migrants try for Europe ?expecting? sea rescue | euronews, world news 14 New Greek government unveiled with radical economist named Finance Minister | euronews, world news 15 Dark matter, dark energy: ESA and CERN set to unravel mysteries of the cosmos | euronews, space 16 Barack Obama?s silly Buzzfeed video goes viral | euronews, world news 17 Shining a light on the Dark Net | euronews, on the frontline 18 Canada: Valentine?s Day mass shooting plot foiled say police | euronews, world news 20 ?Europe?s interests come first?, says new Greek government | euronews, world news
