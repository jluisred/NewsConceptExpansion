TIME NOW TO CHECK IN WITH 					EVERYONE'S FAVORITE FREQUENT 					NON-FLYER, EDWARD SNOWDEN WHO 					WAS LAST SEEN AT THE MOSCOW 					AIRPORT SUBSISTING ENTIRELY ON 					DUTY FREE FOOD. 					BUT SNOWDEN'S AIRPORT VACATION 					MIGHT BE COMING TO AN END. 					>> SNOWDEN'S LAWYERS SAY HE 					COULD LEAVE THE AIRPORT IN THE 					NEXT FEW DAYS AFTER SOME 					PAPERWORK HAS BEEN CLEARED UP. 					JUST A FUN FACT. 					THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE AN 					EXTRADITION AGREEMENT WITH 					RUSSIA. 					>> John: FUN FACT? 					THAT'S NOT A FUN FACT. 					THAT IS PERTINENT INFORMATION. 					A FUN FACT WOULD BE MORE LIKE 					COWS CAN'T WALK DOWNSTAIRS OR... 					THAT'S A FUN FACT. 					IF IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE CARE 					ABOUT IT, YOU CAN JUST CALL IT 					NEWS. 					YOU DON'T NEED TO BE EMBARRASSED 					ABOUT REPORTING IT. 					ANYWAY, PAPERWORK FOR THE 					RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT, I MEAN I'M 					GOING TO GUESS THAT THAT IS A 					COMPLETE NIGHTMARE. 					PAGES AND PAGES OF OFFICIAL 					DOCUMENTS NOTARIZED AND FILLED 					OUT IN TRIPLICATE. 					>> SNOWDEN HAS IN FACT APPLIED 					FOR TEMPORARY ASYLUM IN RUSSIA. 					HE DID SO ON A VERY BRIEF 					REQUEST, INFORMAL TO SAY THE 					LEAST, HANDWRITTEN BECAUSE HIS 					LAWYER SAID THIS WOULD LOOK MORE 					CONVINCING. 					>> John: MORE CONVINCING? 					IS HIS LAURA TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL? 					... IS HIS LAWYER A TEN-YEAR-OLD 					GIRL? 					CAN I HAVE ASYLUM PLEASE? 					CHECK YES. 					IT SEEMS THAT EDWARD SNOWDEN 					MIGHT BE ON HIS WAY SOMEWHERE 					SOON. 					THE QUESTION IS, WHERE? 					>> SNOWDEN HAS BEEN OFFERED 					REFUGE IN VENEZUELA, NICARAGUA 					AND BOLIVIA. 					>> John: BY COINCIDENCE THOSE 					ARE THE EXACT THREE COUNTRIES I 					WOULD NAME IF ASKED WHAT COUNTRY 					WOULD YOU NOT LEAVE A RUSSIAN 					AIRPORT BATHROOM FOR? 					LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF 					OURSELVES. 					FIRST HE HAS TO GET OUT OF 					RUSSIA. 					WHAT DOES PRESIDENT PUTIN PLAN 					TO DO WITH SNOWDEN? 					>> John: HOW SHOULD I KNOW? 					BRING ME HIS BALLS ON A PLATTER 					SO THAT I MAY PLAY WITH THEM. 					OH, SNOW DEP, WHY DID YOU SEEK 					ASYLUM IN A COUNTRY RUN BY AN 					ACTUAL VILLAIN? 					BECAUSE BETWEEN THE EVIL LAUGH 					AND THE UNDERWATER ESCAPE POD, 					ALL HE'S MISSING IS A... AND 					THAT IS AN ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPH. 					YOU ARE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE, 					SNOWDEN.
