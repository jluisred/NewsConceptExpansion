In a moment, we?ll here what other?s are saying about this. Oil drilling and fracking wastewater is being injected back into wells. Can you imagine how much it would cost to have it processed as industrial waste above ground? There was a 5.7 magnitude earthquake in Oklahoma. This has been linked to oil drilling waste water being injected back into wells. It has been shown that injecting the waste water back into the wells increases the pressure, lubricates the seismic fault and can cause man-made earthquakes. The larger dilemma here is that we?re getting desperate trying to replace the cheap conventional easy oil. People will have to accept the risks of increased man-made earthquakes, tar sand pipeline leaks and other environmental concerns. Or we can try and feed our economy with ever increasing energy prices which will of course not allow it to grow. Of course, without this growth, the debt based monetary system may collapse. Let?s see what others are saying about the earthquakes. This video may contain copyrighted material. This material is made available for educational, research, and news reporting purposes only.
