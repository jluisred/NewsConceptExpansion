Prince William and Kate Middleton's baby is no longer nameless. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son George Alexander Louis, reads a statement from Kensington Palace. The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. The news comes a day after the couple first appeared publicly with their new son, born Monday in London. I think they did well! says Pamela Redmond Satran of Montclair, founder of the baby-names website Nameberry.com, and author of Beyond Jennifer and Jason and several other baby-naming guides. They followed tradition by making the kingly choice ? the name of more sovereigns of Britain over the past 300 years than any other ? but broke with tradition by using three names instead of four and NOT giving the child a middle name that honored a father, grandfather or great-grandfather. Satran noted that George is one of the top 100 most common names for boys in England; here in the colonies, despite three presidents who carried the name, George remains a less popular choice. The new parents were visited in the hospital Tuesday by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, and Middleton's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton. The couple stayed mum on Middleton's due date but the press camped outside of St. Mary's Hospital where he was delivered, since July 1. I'll remind him of his tardiness when he's a bit older because I know how long you've all been sat out here, Prince William, 31, told reporters outside of the hospital Tuesday. Hopefully the hospital and you guys can all go back to normal now and we're going to look after him. It's very emotional, Kate, also 31, said of becoming a mother on Tuesday. It's a moment that any parent having just given birth will know what this feeling feels like. Prince William and Middleton returned to Kensington Palace after showing off the baby. The 8-pound, 6-ounce boy is third in line to the British throne, behind Prince Charles and Prince William.
