Home News World The little prince has a name: George Alexander Louis By Jim Lawless - 	 		Associated Press - 												 													 													Wednesday, July 24, 2013 												 	 LONDON AP ? His Royal Highness has a name. Britain?s new prince has been named George Alexander Louis, royal officials said Wednesday, ending speculation over what moniker Prince William and his wife, Kate, would pick for their first child. Kensington Palace said the royals are ?delighted to announce? their son?s name, adding that the 2-day-old baby and third-in-line to the throne will be known as ?His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.? PHOTOS: Royal baby revealed: Prince William and Kate introduce their prince Six previous British kings have been named George, and the name was a favorite of British bookmakers in the run-up to Wednesday?s announcement. For now, the baby is expected to stay out of the spotlight after making his first ?public appearance? in the arms of his parents outside of London?s St. Mary?s Hospital on Tuesday. After leaving the hospital, the couple introduced their son Wednesday to great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who was keen to see the baby before she starts her annual summer vacation in Scotland later this week. Then the young family headed to see Kate?s parents in their village near London. Now that Kate and William have chosen a name, they are expected to soon choose a photographer for the baby?s first official portrait. Copyright ? 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.
