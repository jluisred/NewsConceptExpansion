HRH Prince of Cambridge is already accustomed to riding in style. On Wednesday at around 12:30 p.m. local time, the royal baby, Kate Middleton and Prince William left Kensington Palace for the first time as a family unit. Their vehicle of choice? A sleek black Range Rover, of course! Kate, wearing minimal makeup, sunglasses and her enviably perfect brunette locks pulled back into a ponytail, rode in the backseat alongside the future King of England. And while Wills drove his wife and son home from St. Mary's Hospital on Tuesday, an unidentified male took the wheel for this trip. The first-time father rode shotgun and was all smiles for the outing, looking a bit more dadlike in his rarely worn glasses. Cheering fans greeted the royal trio as they rode away from Kensington Palace. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were clearly appreciative of the kindness and well-wishes, but as new parents, they might prefer a little peace and quiet with their precious prince. If that's the case, Kate, Wills and the Prince of Cambridge could be headed to Michael and Carole Middleton's home in Bucklebury. The royal couple?spent Kate's final week of pregnancy there?out of the spotlight. Then again, maybe mum, dad and their baby boy just didn't want to spend all day cooped up in the palace!

Earlier the next morning, Queen Elizabeth II? popped by the palace for a visit with her great-grandson, too. The royal baby is just 2 days old, but man, his social calendar is already putting the rest of us to shame!
