The Rev. Al Sharpton announced Wednesday that he will lead a national Justice for Trayvon day in 100 cities this weekend to press for federal civil rights charges against George Zimmerman. Saturday, the verdict lost the battle, but we have not lost the war, said Sharpton, a Baptist minister, civil rights activist and talk show host. Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted Saturday of second-degree murder in the February 2012 shooting death of unarmed teen Trayvon Martin in a gated community in Sanford, Fla. The decision by a six-woman jury has ignited protests around the country. The Justice Department has an open investigation into whether Zimmerman, a former neighborhood watch volunteer who said he shot Trayvon in self-defense after the pair fought, violated the teen's civil rights. People all across the country will gather to show that we are not having a two- or three-day anger fit. This is a social movement for justice, said Sharpton, who urged that the rallies be peaceful and non-violent. Rallies and vigils are planned outside of federal court buildings at noon Saturday in Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, New York and other cities, Sharpton said. There is a blatant civil rights question. ... Does Trayvon Martin and the Trayvon Martins of this country have the civil right to go home, Sharpton said of the black teen. Tuesday, Attorney General Eric Holder said that stand-your-ground laws in Florida and other states that allow a person who believes he is in danger to use deadly force in self-defense sow dangerous conflict and need to be reassessed. Holder said he was concerned that Florida's stand-your-ground law played a part in Zimmerman's acquittal. Separate and apart from the case that has drawn the nation's attention, it's time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods, Holder said.
