Kensington Palace said royals are ??delighted to announce?? their son?s name, adding that the 2-day-old baby and third-in-line to the throne will be known as ??His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge.?? Noble names are steeped in history, which explains why thousands of bets rolled in to British bookmakers for the name George, the name of six previous British kings. The moniker evokes the steadfastness of the queen?s father, George VI, who rallied the nation during World War II. The name Louis could be a tribute to Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Duke of Edinburgh?s uncle and the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947. William?s father, Prince Charles, was close with Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the Irish Republican Army in 1979. If Charles plans to take the name George when he becomes king, that evidently means they are sticking with House of Windsor names. That would be limited to Edward, George and William for kings. And Edward is likely out of favor now since the last king with that name Elizabeth?s uncle scandalously abdicated in 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American woman.
