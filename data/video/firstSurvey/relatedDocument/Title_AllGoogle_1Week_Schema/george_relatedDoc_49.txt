George Alexander Louis: It isn?t likely to make the list of 2013?s Top 10 Baby Names, but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge find it just fitting for a future king. After much anticipation and guessing, Kensington Palace announced Wednesday that new parents Prince William and Kate Middleton have decided to call their infant son George Alexander Louis. The moniker gives a hattip to the baby?s paternal great-grandfathers, George V and George VI. The youngster will be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. Will and Kate showed off their new baby yesterday to a throng of crowds and media, who had waited more than a week for the debut of the new prince. The royal baby arrived Monday, July 22 at 4:24 pm BST. Queen Elizabeth II met her great-grandson for the first time at Kensington Palace on Wednesday. The Queen was driven from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace and stayed for 30 minutes to get acquainted with the newest member of the royal family. Kate?s sister, Pippa, was waiting for the royal couple at Kensington on Tuesday to meet her nephew. Will?s brother, Prince Harry, has also met young George. Now that they?ve settled on a name, Will and Kate are getting busy with the task of choosing a royal photographer to take the first official portrait of the baby.Palace officials confirmed yesterday that the couple will not have a nanny and will rely on their families for help to raise baby George. This would be a royal first: William and Harry had three nannies growing up. Kate and William, on the other hand, have said they would like to be ?hands on? parents with the Middletons helping out as much as possible.
