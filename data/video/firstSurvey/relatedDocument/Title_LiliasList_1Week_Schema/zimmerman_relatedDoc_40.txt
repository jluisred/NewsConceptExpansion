The midsummer somnolence of the White House briefing room was rudely disturbed Wednesday by a media intern with a provocative question about the Trayvon Martin case. Because of the death threats being received by George Zimmerman and his parents, is the president going to take any action for their security, or are they on their own? asked Gabe Finger, 16, a journalist-in-training at the Daily Caller. A Florida jury last week found Zimmerman not guilty in the February 2012 killing of Martin, a boy who was about Finger's age. The verdict has provoked passionate demonstrations of disagreement. The death threats could not be independently confirmed. Carney responded that the Zimmerman family is hardly quote on their own, given that George Zimmerman owns a gun and demonstrably has the right in Florida to shoot dead anyone he perceives as threatening . I would refer you to Florida authorities ? The president has called for, echoing the statements of Trayvon Martin's family, for calm reflection in the wake of the verdict, and that continues to be his position, he certainly would oppose any violence of any kind. In an admirable display of journalistic tenacity, Finger followed up. So they're on their own, he said. Carney replied that if by on their own the Daily Caller meant they can now go about their lives secure in the knowledge that their private instincts about someone are enough in Florida to exculpate them should they track and execute that individual, then sure the statement was ridiculous . You can editorialize all you want and I have no doubt that you will, but that is a ridiculous statement, Carney said. Then he took a question about arming Syria's rebels. The Daily Caller has a history of stabbing at the country's open wound of racism. The news outlet took the lead last year in a campaign to stoke race-based fear and resentment at the height of the presidential campaign by peddling an old Obama video as racially incendiary. The campaign failed.
