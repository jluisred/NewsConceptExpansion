Diehard monarchists with cash to splash and spare space in their display cabinet may be tempted to celebrate the royal birth by indulging in some commemorative china. But they had to wait until the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge settled on a name for the newborn until supplies could finally be available. The Royal Collection Trust is producing an official range ? with royal consent. The handmade fine bone china is in blue, naturally, with 22-carat gilding. It includes a pillbox ?30 , a small loving cup ?39 and a dessert plate ?45 . The range features a design of scrolls that incorporate the date of birth of the newest royal, with the lion and unicorn from the Royal Arms supporting the coronet of the Duke and Duchess, surrounded by oak leaves from the Middleton coat of arms. As it will also feature the name of the new prince, production had been stalled, somewhat, by the lack of one. The trust raises money to conserve the Royal Collection, which includes historic works of art, furniture, china and other items acquired by generations of royals and which the Queen keeps in trust for the nation. Each piece will be made in Stoke-on-Trent by the same potteries that produced the official commemorative range for the Cambridges' wedding and the Queen's diamond jubilee. Describing the design, Nuala McGourty from the trust said it was contemporary in style, while maintaining the traditional formality of royal commemorative china . It is available to order online at the Royal Collection shop.
