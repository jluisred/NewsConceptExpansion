Protesters take to the streets of Los Angeles for a second time since George Zimmerman was acquitted for the murder of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin. The demonstration is part of a countrywide outcry among those who believe Zimmerman shot the 17-year-old in a racially-motivated attack. Several protesters were arrested in LA the night before, for refusing to disperse when asked to.
