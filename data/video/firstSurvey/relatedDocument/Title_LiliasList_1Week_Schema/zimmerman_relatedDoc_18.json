President Obama has called for calm reflection in the wake of George Zimmerman's acquittal over the death of unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, noting that America was a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken . Noting that the death of Martin was a tragedy , Obama suggested that it raised questions over whether enough was being done to stem the tide of gun violence . The statement made no reference to any racial element to the killing. Black community leaders are pushing the Department of Justice to launch a federal civil rights case against Zimmerman. Obama has previously commented on the Martin death. In an emotional statement last March ? at the height of furore ? Obama noted: If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. On that occasion Obama suggested that all Americans needed to do some soul searching over how such an death could come about. On Sunday, he echoed that earlier call for a period of reflection. In full, the statement read: The death of Trayvon Martin was a tragedy. Not just for his family, or for any one community, but for America. I know this case has elicited strong passions. And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher. But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken. I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son. And as we do, we should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to widen the circle of compassion and understanding in our own communities. We should ask ourselves if we're doing all we can to stem the tide of gun violence that claims too many lives across this country on a daily basis. We should ask ourselves, as individuals and as a society, how we can prevent future tragedies like this. As citizens, that's a job for all of us. That's the way to honor Trayvon Martin.
