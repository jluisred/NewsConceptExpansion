Egypt's Morsi Vows to Stay in Power 
 
A political crisis in Egypt has entered a new phase within the last few hours as the Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi appeared on state television to say he would not step down. He suggests that he was elected in a free transparent and democratic way.
Speaking for around an hour, the Egyptian president said that he would defend the legitimacy of his office with his life. He acknowledged that his first year in office had been difficult. But he said that some of his opponents were taking advantage of the anger of the country's youth.
Our middle east editor Jeremy Bowen is in Cairo where he spoke to protesters just after they listened to president Morsi's speech:
"We have on one hand, the crowd here saying that he's got to go, and on the other hand, president Morsi saying that he is not going anywhere and at the same time, not far from here, in parts of Cairo as well, there are armed clashes going on between supporters of either side and that is also happening elsewhere in the country."
"It's really an incredibly tense and dangerous moment for Egypt."
Egypt's opposition alliance has reacted to president Morsi's speech saying that his refusal to accept the military ultimatum to share power had put the country on course for a confrontation and more violence.
Well, Cairo is a city divided tonight. This is a scene live where thousands of anti-government protesters remain in Tahrir Square, of course, as they've been doing for the last few days calling for the president to step down. But elsewhere in the city, about eight miles away from Tahrir Square near the capital's university, thousands are rallying in support of president Morsi
