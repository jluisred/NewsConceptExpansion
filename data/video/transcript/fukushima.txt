Fukushima leak causes Japan concern 
 
The melted reactor cores inside the destroyed Fukushima nuclear plant are supposed to be in what is called "cold shutdown".
And yet today, for second time in a week, steam has been seen rising from reactor building number three. Number three is the most badly damaged of the reactors. Radiation levels are still far too high for workers to go inside. So the company that owns the crippled plant, TEPCO, can only guess where the steam is coming from. 
On Monday TEPCO officials, finally admitted that radioactive water is still leaking from the plant into the nearby Pacific Ocean.
"We apologized that we've caused serious concerns. Weâ€™d like to apologize especially to the Fukushima people".
But the ritualized apologies from TEPCO officials are sounding more and more hollow. Outside experts have long suspected the plant was leaking radioactive water. A month ago, the Japanese government own nuclear watchdog said the same. But until this week, TEPCO kept up its denials.
And at the same time that it finally acknowledged the water leaking problem, TEPCO let slip another revelation: the number of workers at the plant, exposed to levels of radiation that could cause cancer, was not one hundred and seventy five as previously reported, but more than one thousand nine hundred, ten percent of the total work force.
